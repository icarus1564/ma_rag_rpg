# Miss Thatcher

My first memory of Miss Thatcher, my great-great-
grandmother's sister, was sitting in her small, brightly-lit
kitchen in the middle of the North Maine Woods. I had a toy
car that I was driving up and down the blue-and-white
checkered tablecloth on the table in the center of the room.

"Wheah yah drivin" to?" Miss Thatcher was standing next
to the sink, framed by the bright summer sun slanting in the
window through the surrounding pine forest. She had just made
tea and was drying the white-and-blue lacquered teapot with a
checkered hand-towel.

I had trouble deciphering her accent... I was six, without
much experience outside my small family or school. As an
aside, for those friends from Maine, please forgive my feeble
attempts to portray a Maine accent... these exaggerations are
based on my childhood memory.

"Uh... nowhere. Just driving." I mumbled. I wasn"t happy
that my family left me alone with Ms. Thatcher. They were off
"birding" " something I loved to do but I couldn"t because of
my stupid broken foot.

She placed the teapot on the counter and turned, drying
her hands. I expected her to scold me for not speaking up, but
instead she just watched me for a moment.


"That's good."


I paused and looked up, "Why?"


"The jurahney's impoahtant."

She held my gaze and I nodded, because it seemed like the
right thing to do. Her bright blue eyes sparkled in a sea of

wrinkles as she smiled.

Nodding, she turned and hung the towel carefully. Turning
back she said, "Let me show yah a secreht."


"A secret?"


"Yep. Come with me."


"Mom told me not to walk too much."

""Taint far, wheah we"ah goin"." She leaned toward me and
pointed out through blue and white curtains framing the window
in the kitchen door, which stood next to the large Franklin
stove where she had boiled the water. "Plus mah tea's gettin"
cold, so we woahn"t be long. Up you get."

With that she pulled my chair back and I stood, clumsily,
hating the huge weight of the cast. It didn"t hurt anymore, it
mostly just itched and got in the way of everything fun.

Nodding she turned and stepped to the end of the counter,
pulling off her apron and putting on a light jacket hanging on
a hook next to the side door. She opened the door and gestured
me through.

Curiosity got the better of me so I forgot to complain as
I hobbled down the porch stairs, gripping the handrail in one
hand and running my car down it with the other. I figured this
was part of the journey as well... and much more interesting
than the checkered tablecloth world I was just driving
through.

The well-tended driveway split midway between the barn
and the house, the right-hand branch leading to the barn and
the left-hand path to a large, solid building the family
called the Still House. Miss Thatcher had shown us the massive
copper still earlier that day, but no-one was allowed in the
barn.

"Why do you have that?" I pointed to the Still House.
"That big copper thing."


"The still? "Twas my grandah's."



"I know, but... you don"t use it, right?"


"Nope."


"Then why keep it?"

She paused and looked down at me. I stopped beside her,
glad for the momentary rest. "Whaht would yah ha" me do
wh"it?"


"I dunno... that much copper must be worth something."

She held my gaze and nodded, "Nope." Something in her
expression told me to be patient, and I was eventually
rewarded with, "Priceless."

She turned and continued toward the barn as if that
answered my question.

"But... if it's priceless... then you could get a LOT of
money for it!"

"Nope." She smiled to herself as we reached the small
door in the larger double door at one end of the barn. She
pulled out a key and unlocked the padlock on the door before
turning to me and asking, "Why not?"

This brought me up short because I was about to ask her
that very same question. "Why... not? You mean, why can"t you
get a lot of money for it?"


"Ayuh."

I stared at her, working out the puzzle. "Because... it has
no price?"

She smiled and nodded, pulling the padlock off the door
and sliding the bolt. 'smaht boy. Still's woahth moah as a
paht of history." She nodded her head toward the inside of the
barn. "'sides, it's puhpose ain"t yet done."


I stepped inside the barn, wondering what purpose a giant
copper still would serve. The thoughts fled as I took in my
pristinely-organized surroundings.

Shafts of sunlight filtered in through skylights in the
curved roof far overhead, glinting off a webwork of copper
veins and fittings lacing the thick beams and logs of the
frame, walls, and roof. The center of the large single room
was subdivided into ten stalls " five to a side. Wherever a
beam or log came close to the ground it was sheathed in
copper, lending a warm glow to the room.

Two large clear areas sat at either end of the barn, with
neat stacks of hay and bags of grain piled on pallets resting
on the stone floor which covered the ends of the barn and wide
aisle between the stalls.

The center of the floor at each end had some kind of
intricate design etched into the stone, inlaid with copper and
silver with veins connecting the patterns to the rest of the
building. My eyes were drawn to one of the patterns but I got
a headache trying to figure out what it was, gasping and
nearly dropping my toy.


"Hmmm? You ah"right?"

"My head..." I closed my eyes and squeezed the bridge of my
nose with my free hand. "Those lines hurt!"


"Look at me, child."

I looked up and for the briefest instant Miss Thatcher's
eyes widened. She clamped down on her surprise immediately and
leaned toward me, taking my shoulders in her hands and fixing
me with her stare. "I see..."


"What do you see?"


"Close yer eyes and breathe deep."

I did as she asked and my headache faded. When I opened
my eyes she was still staring at me, her expression
unreadable. Apparently she liked what she saw, because after a
moment she smiled and straightened, letting go of my
shoulders.


""Tis safe tah look now, child. Just let them pahttahns
be... don" mahke "em mean ahnythin" an" they won"t hurt yah."

Wincing I turned and saw that the lines no longer glowed
as brightly. I relaxed my eyes and let them just be patterns...
they swam briefly but I was able to look at them without
making my head hurt.

Nodding she took my shoulder and led me toward the center
of the barn. Each stall was solid with eight-foot-high walls
and gates that prevented me from seeing inside. When we
reached it she once again bent close and took both my
shoulders in her hands, fixing me once again with her stare.


"Now... this is owah secreht... you unnerstand?"


I nodded and gulped, suddenly nervous.


"I mean it now... promise me yah wohn"t speak of it..."


"I won"t."


"Won"t... what?"

"I promise I won"t speak of this to anyone... ever." It
felt as if she were willing me to say these words. My
curiosity overwhelmed my sensibility, so I just went with it.
"This is our secret."

She held my gaze again for a time and then nodded and
patted my shoulder.

"Now... I thought to show yah the bahn and leave it at
thaht. Now she's asked to meet yah... so meet yah she will."


'she...?" I could feel myself trembling.

"Nothin" here will hurt you, child. You"re safer here
than anywheah else in all the planes that be." She started
walking back to the door.


"Where are you going?"


"This meetin" is for you... and you ahlone." She reached
the door and turned.


"But..."

"Mind yer P's and Q's and you"ll be fine." She stepped
through and closed the door behind her.

I gulped, heart racing, and looked around the silent
barn, saying in a trembling voice... "Hello?"

...and that's where my memory ends of the barn. The next
thing I remember, I was back in the kitchen with Miss
Thatcher. I was finishing up a hot chocolate I didn"t remember
receiving. My family bustled in, breathless with excitement at
all they had seen.

My older brother held up his camera, "I took lots of
pictures for you!"

"You look like you"re getting on famously." I could hear
the relief in my mother's voice. "Hot chocolate's a tad warm
for me, but lemonade sounds really good right about now."

The hustle and bustle of my parents and brother bled
together into an entirely unremarkable ending to an otherwise
remarkable visit.


# A Different Path

We visited Miss Thatcher every summer as part of our
pilgrimage to visit my mother's remaining family. We"d start
out in Bangor with my grandmother, and if the weather behaved
we"d trek the two-and-a-half hours up to Miss Thatcher's farm
in the "far north country" about thirty miles south of the
Canadian border.

My grandmother never came with us. I asked her when was
the last time she visited her aunt and she couldn"t remember.

"We were never close." My grandmother said, cryptically,
'she's always been a bit... private. But she does seem to enjoy
your visits so... off you go!"

I had to admit that I enjoyed the visits as well. Over
the years I got used to Miss Thatcher's accent and grew to
appreciate her wit... she never spoke much but always had
important things to say, and she was very funny in a dry,
sarcastic kind of way. There was also that special connection
we shared, after that one visit to the barn. We"d exchange
glances and nods, though we never spoke of what happened, even
when we were alone.

This time, when we arrived, I had a strong sense that
something had changed. Miss Thatcher always greeted us from
the porch, but this time she was sitting in her rocking chair,
covered in a blue-and-white handknit blanket.

She was as bright as ever, but her voice was thin and her
hands shook a bit. We moved into the kitchen and visited for a
while, my mother insisting on taking care of everything so
Miss Thatcher could sit and relax.

We had been there for a little over an hour. My brother
Toby and I sat at the table with Miss Thatcher, and my mother
stood by the sink wiping down the teapot. The white, lacy


stood by the sink wiping down the teapot. The white, lacy

window drapes fluttering in the cool breeze blowing in from
the forest, where birds chirped and insects buzzed and the
wind sighed through the evergreens.

My dad was no longer in the picture... but that's another
story entirely.

"Mind me, now." Miss Thatcher said, clearing her throat
and looking at me. "I have things to attend to, it's time for
us to part. You woahn"t be seein" me again."

"What?" My mother turned and raised an eyebrow, "What do
you mean? What sorts of things? I"m sure we can""

"None of your concern, young miss." Miss Thatcher always
called my mother young miss, despite the fact that she was in
her forties. "It's been a long, good journey... and now my part
is done."

"But Miss Thatcher!" Toby always tried to take care of
everyone... and he thought he knew precisely how they needed
taking care of. A bastion of good intentions founded in an
astounding lack of awareness. "Look at this place? It's too
much for one old lady."


"Old?" Miss Thatcher cackled, "Ha!"


"I didn"t mean it like that..."


"Then how"d you mean it, boy? Old ain"t gone, yet."


My brother blushed and lowered his head.

"Aunt Sadie, be reasonable." My mother put the teapot
away and hung the dishtowel just so. "We only want to help."

Miss Thatcher relaxed slightly, the intensity of her gaze
fading, and nodded. "I know. You"re good folk, despite bein"
from away." Her eyes twinkled as she turned to me and said,
"And what do you think, child?"

I was dreading this moment. Of the three of us I felt
closest to Miss Thatcher. I felt a pang of impending loss


closest to Miss Thatcher. I felt a pang of impending loss

welling up inside me, knowing that what I said next might well
be the last thing I spoke in her company.

"I think it's been a long, good journey." My voice
quavered as I held Miss Thatcher's gaze, "And for some of us
it's time to take a different path."

Miss Thatcher smiled and nodded while my mother and
brother protested, my mother stepping up behind my brother and
placing her hands on his shoulders. "You can"t be serious?"
she asked as he said, "How's she going to take care of
herself?"

I looked at them and shrugged, "How's she managed to keep
her property in such good shape for so long? She must have
help, and she must know what she's doing. If she doesn"t want
us to watch her linger... or fade away... then that's her
business."

"Well said." Miss Thatcher murmured. "Now... thank you for
the tea and the visit. It's a long trip back to your so-called
civilization, so... fare thee well."

I felt tears sting my eyes as I nodded and stood. My
brother and mother continued to try to talk sense into Miss
Thatcher, but met with frowns, head shakes and silence.

My brother stormed out first, frustrated that his
attempts to help had been thwarted. I turned to go, but as I
walked around her chair Miss Thatcher reached over and took my
hand, her skin was cold and her hand was bony but her grip was
strong and stopped me in my tracks. My mother saw this and
fell silent, taking a deep breath and meeting my gaze.


I nodded and my mother left without another word.

"You"re journey is far from over, child. You"re part of
this place... part of her. This will always be so." She looked
up at me and squeezed my hand. "I will leave everything in
order. You won"t have to do anything until you"re ready, the
lawyers will see to that... however long it takes." She locked
eyes with me. "But WHEN you"re ready, don"t let them take this
place from our family. Don"t let them log it, and don"t let
them hunt it." She wheezed and closed her eyes. It took a


them hunt it." She wheezed and closed her eyes. It took a

moment for her to catch her breath, but when she did look back
up at me she continued in a strong, soft voice. "There's more
secrets here that you"ll have to find for yourself. Find them,
and protect them with everything you"ve got."

I held her gaze when she was done I squeezed her hand and
nodded. "I will."


"You will, what? Promise me."

"I promise to do everything I can to protect this place.
I will not let them take the land from us, log it, or hunt it...
and I will cherish and hold it's secrets as they are shared
with me... like the first time."

"Good." She smiled and relaxed, letting her hand fall to
her lap. "Good boy. Now... go."

"Miss Thatcher?" Tears welled up. I wanted to hug her but
she was never the huggy sort. I wanted to tell her I loved
her, but I didn"t... not really... I respected her and admired
her, but she was still a mystery to me. Quite frankly I was
still a little scared of her even now at the end of her life.

"I know, child." She whispered, drew a deep breath and
closed her eyes again.


...and that was the last time I saw Miss Thatcher alive.

A few months later, as my brother and I were getting
ready to head off to college " me for my freshman year all the
way across the country " the phone rang with the sad news. My
mother took the call.

"I"m sorry, but we were just up there... I have work and my
boys are heading off to college... in a week or so... yes, William
got into UC Davis Veterinary School, full scholarship."

The conversation went on for a while, and when she hung
up my mother said, "Huh," and looked at me.


"What was that?"


"The law firm handling Miss Thatcher's estate. She's
passed, and they wanted us to come up there to go over her
will."

"No way we"re gonna do that... at least I can"t." Toby
piped in, 'school starts next week, and I"m already up to my
eyeballs in homework."

"That's what I told him. Nice man..." She turned to me, "...
he said congratulations, William, on your scholarship."

I felt myself blush even though I didn"t know this
person. "Thanks."

"Anyway, the reading is just a formality... apparently it's
all set up in a trust which has sufficient funds to keep the
land and buildings maintained and pay all taxes and fees for
as long as needed." She smiled at me. "Until you want it, that
is, William."


"Until I want it? What do you mean?"

"Apparently Miss Thatcher left her entire estate " six
square miles in northern Maine, including the house, the barn,
the still and a tidy sum of money " all to you."

"Wow, dude!" Toby exclaimed. True to form he wasn"t
jealous... or at least he didn"t seem jealous. "That's awesome!
I"d sell it if I were you..."

I shook my head and said, "No. Miss Thatcher wants it
kept in the family." My mom raised an eyebrow. 'she told me so
last visit."

"To do what?" Toby asked, "I mean, it's a nice house and
all, but... way the hell up there, you know? Nothing around but
trees and more trees. What are you going to do with it?"

"Nothing, for now. It sounds like the trust will take
care of the estate. Mom? How long did the lawyer say I had
before I would need to step in and do something?"

"Well, he said the trust could last pretty much
"indefinitely", but I"m sure that would be a big waste of


"indefinitely", but I"m sure that would be a big waste of

money... all that land just sitting there, gathering dust..."
Mother picked up her briefcase and started packing for work.

"Nice pun, mom." I smiled and she chuckled. "Like Toby
said, there isn"t anything around there... just the state park,
some small farms, and a bunch of logging companies. Except for
hunting and logging, which Miss Thatcher specifically made me
promise NOT to allow, there's not much to do on the land
except live there, and I can"t do that. Not for at least a few
years."

'still, it seems so sad to just have it sitting there,
empty." She saw the look on my face and sighed. "I get it... you
do what you need to do, dear. I"ll support you no matter what,
but the lawyer was very clear... you can"t touch ANY of the
money in the estate until you take full ownership, at which
point you are responsible for everything. So... veterinary
school will be on your dime until you decide to sell the
property."

"I know. I"ve got the scholarship... I"ll decide what to do
with the estate once I"m through with veterinary school."


The best laid plans, as they say...


# Journeys

Best intentions aside, it wasn"t until many decades later
" and multiple job and location changes " that I seriously
contemplated what to do with the Thatcher estate. I decided to
step away from a wildly successful veterinary hospital I co-
founded in Portland Maine and start my own private practice.
The hospital had grown to the point that the administration
was treating it more like a business than a way to help people
and animals, so it was time to step away.

As I investigated what it would take, I discovered just
how expensive it was to set up a fully-equipped veterinary
clinic.

I waffled back and forth about selling the Thatcher land
or keeping my word. I always felt that my integrity as a
person and as a healer meant keeping my word, holding to my
rather high standards of conduct, and never letting personal
gain get in the way of doing what's right. The conflict came
in when I thought about how many people and animals I could
help, and how the money from the estate and the sale of the
land would allow me to set up the clinic properly, ensuring my
clients got the best possible care.

Since the Thatcher estate was part of my family, I
decided to give Toby a call. Despite the fact that he was an
extremely busy man, he always seemed to make time for me.


"Hey little brother! Long time no LINC... how are you?"


"No "LINC" huh? What happened to "talk"?"

"C"mon, bro, get with the times. I didn"t choose to make
LINC such a part of everyday life, but... I sure ain"t
complainin". Which reminds me... how's the new earbud and optics
working out for you?"


"They"re great... amazing actually. Thank you... they must
have been very expensive."

"Nah... not for me. Working at LINternet has it's
advantages. Plus I gotta do my part to bring my little brother
out of the stone ages."


"Touche." I chuckled, 'so, how are you?"


He sighed. "I"m okay... but Meg and I are finished."

"Oh man, Toby... I"m so sorry. How are Tommy and Sam taking
it?"

"Tommy's a trooper... he's focused on his grades and sports
and getting into college. Sam... well... Sam takes after you...
she's got some pretty high standards and ideals about what a
"good family" means, and obviously divorce doesn"t fit her
world view."


"Is she okay?"

"Yeah... I think so. She doesn"t open up to me as much as
she used to... even without the family trouble she was already
doing the preteen-distancing-from-adults thing. She's spending
a lot of time alone, which worries me a bit, but she's always
been a loner and there's not much I can do other than be here
for her."


"You think a call from me would help?"

'she"d love that! She really admires you, you know... she's
even talking about becoming a vet one day."

"I"ll do that as soon as we"re done chatting. The "vet"
thing will give us something to talk about."

"Awesome! I know that will cheer her up... thanks, Will."
He paused and then asked, 'so... what's going on with you?"

"Well... I"m thinking about moving on from PEVH and
starting my own private practice."


"That's awesome, Will! You"ve always dreamed about doing
that."

"Yeah, and it's about time." I chuckled. "Ain"t gettin"
any younger, here." I sobered and sighed, "Problem is, it's
really expensive to build out a properly equipped clinic... so
I"m thinking about selling the Thatcher homestead."


"No... Will, no. You promised ol" Miss Thatcher."

"I know... that's the sticking point, really. It's been,
what, nearly forty years since she died? Land's been sitting
there, vacant, unused..."


"Will, listen... let me help."

"Toby, did you hear what I said? It's REALLY expensive...
like over a million dollars kind of expensive unless I want to
use the hospital's equipment and space... which for various
reasons I"d rather not."


Toby sat for a moment and then my LINC chirped.


Monitoring offline.


Startled, I asked, "What was that?"

"A little backdoor process we put into LINC for those
times when we don"t want to be overheard."

"Overheard? You mean people can listen in on our
conversations?"

Toby sighed, "No, but the system itself monitors
conversations as part of a national security requirement.
Voice pattern recognition, so it does record what we say, but
legally no-one's supposed to have access to the actual
recordings."

"Wow! That's crazy... this some new government conspiracy
thing?"


"Nah, this type of monitoring has been going on since



"Nah, this type of monitoring has been going on since

the old days of the dialup telephone... but let's not get off
track, here. I paused the monitoring because I want to share
some things that are strictly against my NDAs with LINCorp and
TBI."


"NDA? TBI?"

"Nondisclosure agreements... basically legal contracts
requiring that I keep company confidential information from
leaking out. TBI " The Big Idea " is a multi-corporation think
tank that guides LINternet and Nuoun Corporation. And before
you ask, Nuoun corporation created the Nuoun generator, which
is the next generation energy source for the LIN nodes and
clients. Nuoun generators will likely replace all energy
sources across all technologies in the next decade or so."

"Okay... got it... but why break your agreements? I don"t
want to get you in trouble."

"I know you, Will. You"ll never accept this kind of help
from me unless you knew some things that are covered by these
NDAs."

I sighed, "I doubt you"ll convince me, but okay, Toby...
let's hear it."


"How much do you know about LINternet?"

"Well... I know that you and Ahmer created a startup right
after college and it was acquired by LINternet a few years
later. You"re both bigwigs in that company."

'sort of... except that LINternet IS our company. The
"acquisition" was a ruse to throw potential competitors off
our scent."


"What do you mean?"

"It's a bit of a long story, but we founded our startup
based on some crazy ideas, and learned about this genius "
Cynthia O"Flaherty " who started her own energy company based
on very similar ideas. Her conceptualization led to the
creation of the Nuoun Generator, and ours led to the
Livestream Interconnect Network. When we were ready the three


Livestream Interconnect Network. When we were ready the three

of us went to a consortium of leading tech companies "
basically the top 10 tech companies in the world " and
presented our ideas and a working prototype. The prototype
demonstrated the next generation of communication, data
transfer, and collaboration."


"I bet they were impressed."

'scared is more accurate, I"d say. Our technology made
much of what they were doing, or how they were doing it,
obsolete. We called all of them together because any one of
them would probably just quash our work " pay us a pittance in
an actual acquisition and then bury it forever. When the
bidding wars started we suggested an alternative... an umbrella
oversight group with equal share in our joint companies and
access to our cutting edge discoveries. Five of them agreed,
and The Big Idea was born. They provided guidance and initial
funding for productizing our prototypes... and the LINternet was
born... both the company and the network."


'so... LINternet is your company? You and Ahmer's?"

"Yep. And Nuoun is Cyndi's. We all stepped away from the
marketing, sales, and political front and became chief
scientists... with patents on literally hundreds new
technologies that transformed technology across the globe."
Toby chuckled, "Though Ahmer calls me "Chief Nut" and I call
him "The Skynet Lord"."

I laughed at this, but sobered quickly, 'so... you"re
saying your a millionaire or something?"


"Think bigger..."

"Billionaire?! But Toby..." Then I recalled some of the
things I heard about him... multiple homes, fancy cars, living a
bit of a playboy's life... some of which led to his troubles at
home. "...okay... I see. Why is this covered by your NDA? I mean...
it should be public record, shouldn"t it?"

"The "acquisition" was part of The Big Idea's
requirements. They didn"t want anyone to know that there were
basically three people responsible for the bulk of the core
innovations. That would undermine their influence as leaders


innovations. That would undermine their influence as leaders

in their industries and it would make us targets of corporate
espionage. Being part of an acquisition meant there were
"other people involved" so the source of the innovations could
be masked. If the world knew the truth... we"d probably all be
dead."


"Dead? Seriously?"

"Bro... the corporate world is cutthroat, in some cases
literally. Our technology has put a lot of companies out of
business... including one of the original 5 members of The Big
Idea. There are a few companies who have figured out what we
do and are trying to compete, but none is a serious contender,
yet. If we were to disappear, that would open up a lot of
opportunities for new and existing companies."


"Wouldn"t they simply offer you more money?"

Toby laughed, "Have you been listening? They couldn"t
afford me... not that I put that kind of price tag on myself,
mind you... it's simply the truth. With my patents, shares in
LINternet, Nuoun and TBI, and extraordinary salary... they
wouldn"t have enough money left over to actually run a
business."


'so a million dollars is..."

"Pocket change, little brother. If you need more than,
say, ten million dollars, I might have to move a little money
around. I can transfer less than two million right now from
one of my private accounts, no questions asked, no taxes, no
strings."


"Wait... no taxes? How does that work?"

"Who knows? I have a team of top-notch accountants who
handle that. Given that this would be for a noble cause, I"m
sure they"d find a loophole covering you for the rest of your
professional career. All perfectly legal, of course."


"I... I don"t know what to say, Toby."

"Then say yes, stupid." He took a deep breath and sighed.
"Look, it gives me great pleasure to think that I can help my


"Look, it gives me great pleasure to think that I can help my

little brother in this way. Just imagining all the amazing
things you"ll do... all the people and animals you"ll help... I
get all warm and fuzzy inside thinking I helped with that."

I took a deep breath to calm my pounding heart. "Okay,
Toby... you"ve convinced me."


"Fan-tastic! Just a sec."


My LINC chimed with the message Monitoring Online.

"Are you sure a million dollars is enough? Pad your
estimate! You never know what things may come up."

"Well... my wildest estimate was about one-point-two
million."


"William... please. Pocket change. Let me give you more."

"No, Toby... not that I don"t appreciate it, but I know I"d
just waste it if I had too much to play with. I don"t have
big, innovative ideas like you. It's better for me to be on a
shoestring and focus on what's needed to help my clients than
trying to figure out how to spend a wad of cash."

"I understand... more than you can know." He paused for a
moment and added, "You"re awesome, Will."


"I"m awesome?! You"re making my dream come true!"

I could hear him smiling. "And you"ve given me a gift,
little brother. I have to be honest... I"ve always been a little
envious of how you stick to your ideals through thick and
thin... I really admire you for that."

"I... thank you, Toby. This is amazing." I felt myself
tearing up.

"You"ll be contacted by... let's see... Grace Conelly. She's
a top notch lawyer who"ll handle everything. Any question,
legal, corporate, accounting... just ask her. She's been part of
my inner circle for years now, and she's really, really good."


"I"ll watch out for"" My LINC chirped. "Oh! Hey... that was
fast."

"Told you she's good. Anyway, I gotta go... Happy early
48th birthday, bro!"


"Thank you, Toby. I love you."


"Backatcha buddy, bigtime."

With that he ended the connection... and my dream of a
state-of-the-art clinic became a reality.


# Early Retirement

In my years at PEVH I worked with some very smart people.
They pushed the envelope on innovative surgical procedures and
saved thousands of lives.

Because of my relationship with Toby, I watched the tech
news, and saw a lot of great innovations happening that were
based on LINternet technology. There were surprisingly few
advances in the veterinary field, so I encouraged my
colleagues to think about LINternet and LINC even though it
was far beyond my ken.

As a result, PEVH ended up being one the first
organizations in the nation to publish several novel
approaches for using the now ubiquitous LINC in veterinary
diagnosis and surgery. They pioneered some amazing LINC-
connected tools that allow a single trained vet to do the work
of an entire team, with inhuman precision and speed " two
primary factors for success in surgical procedures.

I joked with them that they would put surgeons out of
business if they kept it up. Without a trace of irony they
said that that was the plan, and I saw the writing on the wall
for an old school vet like myself.

As technology solved more and more of the physical
challenges, PEVH needed more of my help for those highly
emotional situations... where old age, fatal injuries, or
incurable diseases left no option other than euthanasia.

Seeing the deep sorrow on the faces of people as I
explained that their beloved pet is suffering and should be
euthanized... and the pain and fear of the animals themselves...
let's just say I grew tired of my partnership with the grim
reaper. I knew that I was truly helping the animal and their
humans, and that ultimately the families appreciated it, but
it broke my heart every time.


This was one of the strongest drivers for me to leave
PEVH. It took me a few years to research, build, and then
start my private practice, so the transition was slower than I
really wanted, but when we opened we "hit the ground running".

I made sure to set it up so I could focus on what I did
best. I kept the team and practice small, being careful not to
steal clients from PEVH, but I couldn"t help that several of
my long-term clients moved with me. PEVH grumbled a little but
ultimately handled it well... they had a lot of business, and
the innovations they created " and the patents they owned "
served them very well.

My private practice did well, focusing on the "human side
of veterinary care" rather than making money. I decided at the
start that I would not only keep it small, but also work to
help up-and-coming vets and vet techs establish themselves. I
felt this was part of my responsibility as an old codger with
lots of experience, and, of course, a lot of opinions about
what "doing it right" meant.

After nine years I had supported and mentored four new
vets and seven vet techs, and I felt just as good about this
as I did about helping my clients.

When I started thinking about retiring after over 30
years as a practicing veterinarian, I was mentoring Alice, who
was halfway through veterinary school, and we worked with
Jeremy, who had just graduated college.

Alice handled a majority of our clients under my
supervision, and she was by far the most competent of the
younger students I had taken on.

Jeremy was that rare combination of extremely empathetic
and extraordinarily capable. He was by far my favorite tech to
work with.

I still did most of the surgeries and saw my small
collection of long-term clients, but I found myself stepping
back more and more as Alice and Jeremy found their way.


It was hard, as they were both wonderful people, but it



It was hard, as they were both wonderful people, but it

was time. "Leave on a high note", as they say...

...the trouble was, being a vet was all I knew. I had no
idea what I"d do with myself if I wasn"t helping animals and
their pet humans.

One morning I opened my mail and found my yearly summary
from the Thatcher estate. The property was still intact... all
fees and taxes paid for with a fair amount of money left over.
Per usual there were offers to purchase the property " highest
offer was $228 thousand, which I knew was an extreme low-ball
for six square miles of virgin forest, let alone the
farmhouse, still, and barn. It was the same logging companies
who kept trying to grab the property, but the Trust held
strong... as I would have to if I took over.

I pictured the property in my minds-eye and found myself
focusing on the still. "What if..." I muttered and then laughed
at my crazy idea.

Well... what if I took up the property and tried to
actually make something of it rather than just living there
"collecting dust"? There were hundreds of micro-breweries and
micro-distilleries popping up all over the place. I had a
background in science with a fair amount of chemistry... and I
loved good whiskey. I had enough money squared away to live
pretty comfortably, particularly on a patch of land that was
all paid for. Add what was left in the trust, a conservative
hundred thousand for the sale of my current house, and
conservatively a million or so from selling the clinic...

...no wife, no kids, no strings... and I wouldn"t even need
to earn money to survive. Whatever whiskey I produced could be
complete crap, but it would be fun figuring it all out.


"What the hell." I chuckled, "It"ll be an adventure."


I had no idea.


# Parting Gifts

Reality is always much more complicated than fantasies.
Logistically I couldn"t just walk away from my practice, I
still had about forty clients scattered around the Portland
area who depended on me, and of course Alice and Jeremy would
both need time to find other jobs.

Once I made my decision, though, things seemed to happen
quickly. I had some conversations with PEVH and they decided
to opened a new clinic catering to more routine, "humanistic"
animal care " based entirely on the success of my little
practice.

There were some grumbles amongst my clients " folks
didn"t like change " but the majority of the response was some
form of "good for you" and "about time".

I suggested that Alice and Jeremy take a look at the new
PEVH clinic and within a week both received offers. Alice had
been paying out of pocket for veterinary school, and part of
her offer was a full scholarship tied to interning with one of
the professors who "happened" to be heading up the clinic. I
was secretly proud of this because I had gently prodded that
particular professor, one of my good friends, to take part in
the clinic.

Jeremy surprised us all by deciding to move in with his
boyfriend Josh, who had just moved to Boston " a big move to
the big city for both of them.

We had three official parties, one for the grand opening
of the new clinic, one which we hosted at my clinic for all
our clients as a way of saying thank you, and, a day before my
private clinic went on the market, a final one with just the
three of us.


"Will," Alice said, her voice somber, "We really need you



"Will," Alice said, her voice somber, "We really need you

to know how much you"ve meant to both of us."

"Yeah." Jeremy added, his voice hushed. He had been
uncharacteristically quiet all day.

"Well... likewise. You"ve both taught me so much... and
you"ve been an absolute joy to work with."

"Thanks, and... there's no way we could repay you for all
you"ve done for us."


"Nonesense, I""

"Hear us out, okay?" Jeremy's voice quavered. "You"ve
been like a father to me, helping out when my family went off
the deep end about Josh and me. I still have no idea how you
did it, but my own dad is one of my biggest supporters now,
all thanks to you."


"I"m sure he would have come around."

Jeremy shook his head. "No. He was always like "be a man"
and "marriage is for men and women". I never told you this,
but... when I came out to him, he slapped me and then didn"t
speak to me until after you had your talk with him." Jeremy
sniffed and wiped his cheek. "It was four months of hell."


"Oh, Jeremy... I"m so sorry."


"Point is... shit... sorry..." He was crying in earnest now.

"Take your time." I put my hand on his shoulder. He
stepped in, sobbed, and hugged me. I held him until he
regained his composure. When he let go and stepped back Alice
gave Jeremy a big hug. He smiled, wiped his face, and looked
back at me.

Josh continued, "The point is that you saved me. And I"m
not the only one." Alice nodded at this. "You have no idea how
rare it is to find someone who cares so much and is so willing
to be there... to be real."


"We will always be here for you, no matter what." Alice



"We will always be here for you, no matter what." Alice

chimed in. "Just like you"ve always been here for us."

"Don"t know what I"ll be able to do from down south, but
whatever it is..." Jeremy sniffed again and straightened. "Don"t
forget that we love you... you are the family we choose."

"I..." I wiped my own tears and said, "Thank you. You are
truly a gift... both of you."

'speaking of gifts..." Alice looked at Jeremy who nodded.
They turned and picked up a card off the table behind them,
handing it to me together. "Here."


"Oh... you... I told you no gifts."


"Oh you won"t like this." Alice laughed, "Not one bit."

"Oh, well then that's okay I guess." I laughed with her
and opened the card, catching a folded piece of newspaper that
fell out as I did so. They had each written something, pretty
much what they had just said.

After reading their words and breathing through my
reaction in an attempt to not cry again, I took a look at the
newspaper clipping. Across the back one of them had written
the word 'sorry!" in red marker.

With trepidation I unfolded the clipping and saw that it
was a posting from one of the animal rescue groups we work
with " Rescue All Dogs " asking the usual "if anyone has any
information" about two English Mastiff puppies someone found
on an abandoned farm. The article was dated this morning.

"Wow..." English Mastiffs were my heart breed. I had
several of them over the years, taken in from rescue
situations like this. I was between dogs right now, and had
been so for some time. I looked up at Jeremy and Alice and
said, "Why didn"t Janet tell me about this?"

'she didn"t know if you were interested in one last
rescue checkup, especially one with Mastiffs." Alice peered at
me, tilting her head. 'so... are you?"


"Yeah... sure... I guess..." I stared down at the picture of



"Yeah... sure... I guess..." I stared down at the picture of

the two fawn puppies and I felt my heart skip a beat. One was
much larger than the other, and the smaller one was definitely
not healthy. The picture was a bit blurry, but the larger one
seemed to have something wrong with their neck.

"Will... please... don"t do this if you don"t really want
to." Jeremy stepped closer and put his and on my arm. "I know
how you feel about situations like this. We weren"t going to
tell you but then we thought this timing can"t be a
coincidence."

Alice nodded, "It feels right, somehow... but we understand
if you don"t agree."

"No, sorry, I..." I wiped my eyes. "I"d love to check them
out, make sure they"re healthy... and help however I can."

"Great!" Alice stepped back and I subvocalized into her
LINC. Almost immediately there was a knock on the back door of
the clinic.


Startled, I said, "Uh..."

"They"ve been waiting. We"ve got the larger examination
room prepped. You want to do your usual?"

I took a deep breath and nodded... and found myself
smiling. "I"ll get cleaned up and meet you there."

Alice and Jeremy smiled back and left. I put the card
down and pulled out some sanitizer, gloves, and a disposable
apron from the box that "just happened" to be sitting next to
the sink, chuckling at the obvious conspiracy.

As I scrubbed my hands and arms I thought about what I
was going to do. My rational mind knew that I should check
them out, ensure that they were okay, and grant RAD the thumbs
up to have them adopted out.

My emotional side simply laughed at that preposterous
idea.

I finished scrubbing, donned the gloves and apron, took a
deep breath, and started the next chapter of my life.



# Adoption

"Hey Janet." I called out as I rounded the corner. Janet,
her rescue partner Chloe, Alice and Jeremy were clustered
around the door to examination room 3.

"Will! So good to see you... you traitor." Janet stepped up
and punched my arm.

"Yeah, well... time to move on." I rubbed my arm, "and ow!"
Turning I nodded to Chloe.

'she's a brute. See what I have to put up with?" Chloe
said as she stepped up and gave me a hug. "Congratulations,
Will... you deserve something great."


"Like two Mastiff puppies?"

Chloe stepped back and she and Janet sobered and
exchanged a glance.


"Uh oh... trouble?"

"Well... one of them is pretty obviously sick " irregular
heartbeat, possibly some fluid in his lungs, slow to respond "
and the other is remarkably protective of his brother." Janet
shook her head. "I"ve never seen an English this aggressive,
especially as a puppy."


"Aggressive?"

"Yes, for an English. Bearing teeth, growling, even
getting a little snappy when we get too close." She held up
the long, heavy gloves she sometimes uses with troubled dogs.
"Latched on at one point but didn"t really bite down. Still a
soft-mouthed Mastiff, but..."



"Huh." I took a deep breath and stepped up to the window.

There was no furniture in the room... my SOP with new pups
is to observe them in an uncluttered environment, interact
with them and get some basic idea of how they will react, and
then go from there.

The sickly pup was curled up in a tattered blue blanket
in one corner of the room.

The other pup sat over his brother, staring at the door,
alert and wary. He stiffened when he saw me.

"Wow. He's really big." I turned to Janet and asked, "How
old would you say they are?"

"Hard to tell, they are both so skinny, but I"d say no
more than three months."

I nodded and turned back, "Yeah... have they eaten or drunk
anything?"

"We gave them some high protein puppy food which the big
one gobbled down, once we stepped back. The other one drank a
little but wasn"t interested in eating."

"That's a bad sign." I turned to Alice, "Would you go
grab some of that new specialty mix " venison, chicken, and
pork if you would please. And Jeremy... let's get a jug of
water, a dish and baster."

"Yep." "Right away." They rushed off and I turned to
watch the pups some more. The sickly one stirred and his
brother bent down and sniffed his head... never taking his eyes
off the door. I could see a gash on the big one's head and
what looked like rope burns on his neck. "Wow... something
happened to them. At so young an age, too. Where did you find
them?"

'some kids found them at the Old Sotholk Farm, about 20
miles west of Lewiston."


"Tell me what happened."


'some kids were playing there " trespassing, really, the
place was abandoned a long time ago and the buildings were all
falling down. They found the pups tied to a stall door in the
barn and had the presence of mind to call their parents."
Janet shook her head, "Did you see those rope burns?"


I nodded. "Fuckin" humans."


"You got that right."

Alice arrived with the food in three separate packets. As
I took them Jeremy came up carrying the bowl, jug and baster.
I put the packets and baster in the bowl so I could carry it
all.

"Okay, you know the drill... don"t come in unless I"m in
serious trouble." Turning back to the door I initiated my
LINC's conference mode. Immediately Alice and Jeremy joined.


"Here sir." Alice and Jeremy responded through my LINC.

"Can you see what I"m seeing?" I turned my head and
looked around.

"Yep... oh god, my hair's a mess!" Jeremy said and then
laughed. 'sorry."

"Be careful, Will." Chloe said. "He's more dangerous than
he should be at that age."

"Ayuh." I winked and Chloe and they laughed... we had a
running joke about me trying to be "more Maine" and less "from
away".

I took a deep breath, calmed my nerves, and nodded to
Jeremy. He opened the door and I slowly and carefully stepped
into the room.

When Jeremy closed the door behind me I could hear the
faint rumbling growl from the larger brother.

"Hey buddy." I breathed in and thought calm, loving
thoughts. "Just thought I"d visit for a while."


I stepped along the wall to my left, carefully watching
and listening to their reaction. The big guy seemed to be okay
with me sitting in the corner across from them, so I did,
moving slowly as I arranged the things I brought with me. I
was careful not to bang against the cabinets as I leaned back
and took a deep breath.

As I breathed out, thinking calm, loving thoughts, I
opened one of the bags of food. The sickly one raised his head
and turned to look at me and his brother tilted his head.

"Yeah... that's right..." I breathed, gently placing the open
bag on the floor between us and picking up the next bag. "I"m
here to help."

The sickly one pushed himself into a sitting position and
turned toward me. I met his gaze and smiled. "That's it,
buddy."

He struggled to his feet, staggering along the wall. His
brother stood, staring back and forth between me, the bag of
food on the floor, and his brother.

I heard some noises from the hall " though I was sitting
against the wall with the door in it so I couldn"t see what
they were doing. The protective one stepped forward, ears up,
and started growling at the door.


"Quiet please." I said softly, "There's a good boy."


'sorry." Alice whispered through my LINC.

Meanwhile the sickly one staggered on. His brother tried
to get between us, still eyeing the bag of food, but the
sickly one pushed past and continued toward me.

When he reached me I could hear his breath rasping and
gurgling slightly. As sick as he was he held his head up and
met my gaze. His brother loomed over us, not growling but
distinctly alert and uncomfortable, so I was careful not to
reach out or do anything that might be considered a threat.


My heart wept for the poor sick creature and his



My heart wept for the poor sick creature and his

frightened brother... and then broke when the sickly one started
slowly wagging and pulled himself onto my lap.


"Oh god..." Jeremy murmured, his voice hitching.

I kept my voice low and gentle, eyes on the pups. "Alice,
is that newfangled LINC ultrasound gadget in here somewhere?"

"Yes sir, it's in the cabinet... should be right next to
you."

"The whole unit? Including the syringe armature and IV
bags?"

"Yes sir. We put all the stuff going to the PEVH in those
cabinets."


"How handy."

As I spoke the larger pup stepped back a bit and regarded
me, ears dropping slightly. His brother was draped across my
lap, head resting on my stomach. I adjusted the sickly one
slowly and carefully, lining him up on top of my legs to help
him breathe easier. He sighed and his tail thumped against my
shins.

I sat, gently petting the sickly one, looking at his
brother without staring him in the eyes. I could clearly see
the rope burns on his neck, and he had a gash on his head that
had only partly healed. Sitting as I was his head was nearly
level with mine...


...he was a very big boy.

"There, you see?" I whispered, "I"m going to try to help...
but you"re going to have to trust me, just a little... okay?"

I reached one hand very carefully to the bag of food
beside him him. I pushed it against the floor and squeezed out
a little food.

The big pups nose went wild and he started drooling. He
stepped further back and hesitated, eyes jumping from the


stepped further back and hesitated, eyes jumping from the

small pile of food to his brother and up to my face.


"Go on... it's okay."

Something in the way I said that... or perhaps just a
decision he finally made at that point... prompted him to lower
his head and snarf down the food. Of course, being an English
Mastiff, he got most of it in his jowls, smeared on the floor,
and some on my leg.

"There you see?" I chuckled as he looked back up, lapping
at his loose lips. "Here." I picked up and opened the second
bag, sliding it toward him.

He dove in. As he worked out how to get the food from the
bag I took the opportunity to reach over into the cabinet. It
took some doing, but I managed to get the devices I needed out
of their box before the big guy finished his noisy, messy
meal.

He stepped closer, dripping food and drool, and sniffed
at the new items sitting next to me. I let him examine
everything, breathing and thinking calm thoughts. When he
finally looked back up at me his entire demeanor had changed.
His ears were down and he even wagged a little.


"Hey there, big boy."

At my voice he looked at me, tilted his head and wagged
some more.

"I"m going to do something to help your brother, but it
might be a little scary..." I patted the sickly one and touched
his chest. "You see... I think there's fluid in his lungs. I"m
going to try to get it out. That will help him feel much
better..." I took a deep breath and teared up as I whispered,
"He might even live through the day..."

The big one lay down, staring up at me, licking some more
of his meal off the floor, his face, and his front legs.


"Thank you."


It took a few minutes to hook everything up... fortunately



It took a few minutes to hook everything up... fortunately

" or perhaps unfortunately " I had used this device several
times on dogs with congestive heart failure so I was very
familiar with how it worked. The big guy watched me, raising
his head and occasionally standing to investigate every new
thing I did. I let him, only continuing when he seemed
satisfied.

Once the device was ready it only took a moment to
confirm my suspicion. There was a significant amount of fluid
in the sick pup's chest cavity. The ultrasound and armature
worked perfectly, with the LINC-enhanced visuals, automated
scanning and fine motor controls, I managed to drain more than
a quart of fluid.

I got all the fluid I could see, and I tried to be as
thorough as I could without taking to long or poking too much.

The sick one didn"t move the entire time, though he was
awake and watching me. The device was self-anesthetizing, and
I was gratified with how little it seemed to bother my
patient.

When I removed the armature and put the machine away, the
sick one pushed himself up and flopped over my lap, nosing at
the remnants of the second food bag.


"Hah... so... hungry?"

"Oh my god." Alice whispered in my LINC. I heard Jeremy
gasp.

I opened the third bag and scooped a fingerful. My
patient nearly took my finger off. His brother stood and
watched, licking his lips and drooling, but didn"t try to
interfere.

I laughed and scooped, wrestling gently with the
increasingly energetic pup on my lap, and getting food
everywhere.

We finished the bag and my patient lapped at the bits of
food that had somehow gotten on my face, adding his drool and
even more food in the process. He then wobbled over to sniff
and slurp at the mess his brother had made.


They sniffed, slurped and drooled over each other and
even started to play a bit, evoking even more quiet, happy
sounds from Alice and Jeremy.

My legs and back were aching, so I pushed myself up
slowly and stiffly, using the wall for support. The big pup
paused to look up at me but returned immediately to his
brother, who seemed to have regained some his strength.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur. We learned pretty
quickly that the sickly one was a loving goofball - your
typical English Mastiff " but as we examined him further we
discovered he had a severe congenital heart condition that was
very likely fatal. We ran some tests to see if there was
cancer involved, but even if there was it wasn"t likely
anything that could be done. He"d need constant medical
supervision if he had a prayer of surviving, and even then the
prognosis was not good.

His big brother was incredibly healthy " a true Giant
among giants at 3 months and 65 lbs " but he very quickly
showed us that I was the only human allowed anywhere near
either of them. I was gratified at how quickly he started
trusting me, but he didn"t show the same acceptance of the
others. Fortunately we were prepared for this so no one got
hurt, but it was obvious that he had some serious personality
quirks that were highly unusual in an English Mastiff.

So... in a nutshell... they were both unadoptable, at least
in their current state.

The fact that I was retiring, and thus would have plenty
of time to attend to their needs, made this decision all the
more obvious. As Jeremy had said, this didn"t feel like
"coincidence".

So guess who adopted them? Or, more accurately, guess who
they adopted?


# The Road Home

A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single dream...
or, as in my case, a single "wild idea".

I spent most of my journey to retirement connecting to
people and businesses through my LINC, partly due to the fact
that everyone did business this way, but also due to the two
new companions in my life... Frank and Fezzik.

Frank, the sickly one, was doing well, though he needed a
procedure every couple of weeks or so to drain the fluid that
still accumulated in his chest. The cancer results came back
negative. His heart disorder left him in a permanent state
similar to congestive heart failure.

There were drugs that could help, but they were
contraindicated for both puppies and large breed dogs. I
wrestled with this, since he likely wouldn"t live out the year
anyway, but decided that since he responded so well to the
simple physical treatment we"d just continue that course of
treatment until other opportunities arose. If he lived past
puppyhood we"d have more options.

The veterinary hospital very kindly agreed to loan me the
LINC-enhanced equipment indefinitely... in exchange for a
detailed writeup of how I used it and the results each time I
did. I would need this when I was alone with Frank in the
north woods.

Thinking about heading out into the boonies with Frank
gave me an idea. I assembled a complete suite of surgical and
diagnostic equipment, taking some of the equipment from my
clinic, and outfitted my truck as a mobile surgery unit. I
used the last of the funds from Toby to acquire one of the new
high-capacity mobile Nuoun generators... I figured having an
unlimited power source in the back woods would be very
helpful. I was able to acquire the generator because I was


helpful. I was able to acquire the generator because I was

still a licensed veterinarian... and even then it took some
finagling from my friends at PEVH to make it happen.

Knowing that I had what I needed to ensure Frank's
survival " as much as I could " gave me tremendous peace of
mind. It helped that Frank never seemed to mind his
treatments, and when he felt well enough he was always
attentive and goofy, dancing and jumping around, playing with
toys or what he decided were toys, and generally creating a
joyful mess wherever he went.

More than anything Frank loved to dance. He had his "good
morning dad" dance, his happy food dance, his "wow a toy"
dance, his "cheer up Fezzik" dance, and his completely random
dancing-cause-he-can-dance-dance. I even thought about
changing his name to Fred, after Fred Astaire, but Frank
suited him better in my mind.

Frank had a special dance he reserved for when people
came to visit, and he quickly formed a large collection of
adoring fans. Neighbor kids would come by asking for some
"Frank Time". Fezzik and I would watch over the noisy,
rambunctious proceedings, making sure no one got hurt, unable
to stop laughing or wagging at the pure joy Frank created
everywhere he went.

As for Fezzik, he was a picture of perfect physical
health and mental neurosis.

His wounds healed quickly, but he wouldn"t tolerate a
collar and reacted badly to ropes and leather leashes. I ended
up getting an extra-large leather harness and chain with
leather grips so I could take him on walks. I felt it was
important to get Fezzik out there as he was shy with people,
but never aggressive as long as I was there to introduce them.

I spent a lot of time and energy training Fezzik, knowing
that he"d top 250 pounds easily and it would be impossible to
control him otherwise. The primary thing I taught him when we
were home was to go to his special bed in the house and stay
there until I came to get him. I worked on this incessantly...
fortunately for me Fezzik was strongly food-motivated so it
was a little easier than it would otherwise have been.


For walks I worked on "leave it" and the usual 'sit,
down, stay" combinations. A friend of mine helped out " she
was a master trainer " and taught me all the proper hand
gestures so I could control Fezzik as if by magic.

Frank seemed to pick up on all of this training by
osmosis. Whenever I gestured for Fezzik to 'sit", if Frank
were nearby he sat as well... unless he was dancing.

One time we were out on a walk and a rather nattily-
dressed gentleman woofed at us, probably thinking that
Fezzik's outfit indicated that I was into some alternative
lifestyles. It was flattering " here I was, a dumpy mid-
fifties guy on the LL Bean spectrum of fashion and covered in
more than a little Mastiff hair and drool " but I just smiled
and waved and moved on. I had no time for romance during my
life transition, even if I was attracted to men.

Later that day, as I sat down to dinner, I paused and
reflected that I didn"t seem to have time for romance at any
point in my life. There was always too much going on " work
normally meant some kind of life-or-death situation and long
hours with patients and their humans. Mentoring my colleagues
took time and dedication. There were always more animals and
people in need of my help than hours in the day.

I looked down at Frank, who sat next to me, and said,
"Hmmm... well... looks like it's just the three of us, huh?"

Frank gazed up at me adoringly, tail swishing across the
floor. He was moving slow and having a little trouble
breathing " it was time for another treatment, which I would
do after dinner.

Fezzik came up on my other side and pushed his massive
head under my arm, loose skin pulling back as his head emerged
between my arm and body " something my friends and I
affectionately called his "armpit birth" maneuver.

At five and a half months Fezzik's head was taller than
my dining room table when he stood next to it. His size,
coupled with this armpit birth move " which he always timed
perfectly, catching my arm as I brought food or drink to my
mouth " meant that dinners were often a quite bit messier and


mouth " meant that dinners were often a quite bit messier and

more interactive than typical polite company would allow. I
could have trained him out of it, but since it was only me at
the table, and he always looked so hopeful and happy to be a
part of my meal despite the fact that I never let him sample
anything... I let him do his thing. The few times we had guests
I had both dogs stay on their beds, usually with some kind of
bribe " a bone or peanut-butter-filled toy to chew on.

Sitting there surrounded by my companions I felt a strong
surge of love for them. Frank in particular, with his amazing
way of communicating and uplifting everyone's spirits. I loved
them both, but Frank was my "heart companion", with whom I
shared the closest bond of any creature in my life.

The trouble was, Frank wasn"t getting better. Every few
weeks I took a tiny bit more fluid, and every few weeks he got
a little slower, a little more clumsy, and a little more run
down before his treatment. He was growing, so his chest cavity
was expanding and retaining more fluid... the overall effect of
his condition was wearing him down, slowly but surely. I took
to reducing the time between his treatments, as the treatments
didn"t seem to bother him at all, and this was not a trend I
could continue much longer.

It broke my heart to think I was going to lose him sooner
rather than later.

That evening after Frank's treatment I realized that I
wanted to bring him to his new home " the Thatcher homestead "
and let that be where he danced his final dance. There was
something right about that image. He was very social and loved
people, but he was also very sensitive. I just imagined what
it would be like at the end surrounded by weeping, grieving
people.

So instead of following the plan to sell my current house
before moving " which would likely take six months or more at
the rate I was going " I LINC"d the lawyer to find out how
soon they could meet me.


"How about tomorrow afternoon?" was the response.

I set up the appointment and spent the rest of the
evening packing " including the necessities I would need in


evening packing " including the necessities I would need in

case the farmhouse was unlivable " and contacting folks to let
them know what was going on.

The next morning, after months of following my carefully-
laid-out plan, I abandoned it, dropped my house keys off with
a neighbor, and headed Northeast...


# Perambulations

The day was overcast and cool, early September in
Northern Maine. I drove to the law office, which was on Main
Street in the middle of Presque Isle, and managed to find
street parking for my large truck right out front.

This was the longest road trip I"d taken with the dogs "
over 280 miles. Fezzik and Frank spent the time slobbering all
over the windows or sleeping on the bench seat, which I left
clear for just that purpose. Everyone arrived intact, happy,
and a little damp.

Fezzik wasn"t on high alert as I parked the truck, which
was unusual. Since the windows were open a crack I wondered if
he could break through if he got agitated enough. Fortunately
the law office was right there next to the truck and had large
plate-glass windows so I could keep an eye on things. I was
also glad that it was overcast, as the truck might otherwise
get too hot for them even with the windows open.

I had some specially-prepared toys " giant hollow rubber
tubes filled with peanut butter and random bits of kibble "
which I hoped would distract them for a while. We took two pit
stops during the four-and-a-half-hour drive, but I wasn"t sure
how long I would be so another walk was necessary.

It took nearly five minutes or so to get Fezzik
harnessed, at 175 pounds and 31 inches at the shoulder I
couldn"t lift him easily, especially since I was leaning over
from the front seat at an awkward angle. He decided we were
playing a great game which involved rolling over just when I
had the harness ready to fasten and Frank decided in the
middle of all this that it was time to wash my face, so by the
time we were ready I was quite a sweaty mess.

When I got out of the car I saw a middle-aged gentleman
in a nice tweed suit standing at the door to the law office. I


in a nice tweed suit standing at the door to the law office. I

was suddenly very aware of how I must look " hair standing on
end, flannel shirt covered in drool and hair " and I had to
laugh.

"You got a baby in there? It looked like you were
changing a diaper or something." His voice was deep and
reassuring.

I looked at the tinted windows and realized he wouldn"t
be able to see inside. I laughed and answered, "Yes... sort of.
I brought my pups with me, and they need a little walk, so I
had to put on their harnesses."


He perked up, "Dogs? What kind?"


"English Mastiffs."

"Hmmm, not familiar with that breed." He stepped out of
the doorway and walked toward the truck. I quickly stepped
around the front to intercept him. I didn"t want his
introduction to English Mastiff's to be Fezzik reacting to a
stranger.

The man extended his hand as we got closer. "Richard
Harding. You must be William Adkins. You"re a little early for
your appointment."

"Yes... I wasn"t sure how long it would take. It's good to
meet you, Mr. Harding."

"Likewise, and please call me Richard." To his credit,
Richard didn"t bat an eyelash when we shook hands, despite my
damp skin and the dog hair fluttering off me. His grip was
strong and his gaze steady... I felt like this was someone I
could trust. "An honor, really, to meet a living descendant of
the Thatchers."

"That sounds so formal... and please call me Will." He
nodded and smiled as we stepped back. I gestured toward the
truck and said, 'so... I"m early, and I do need to take them for
a walk."

"Well, as it turns out my lunch appointment just
canceled, so I"m free now... perhaps we can walk together and I


canceled, so I"m free now... perhaps we can walk together and I

can show you a little of our town?"


"Do you like dogs?"

"Love them, actually... I have two setters. I normally
bring them to the office, but I knew you might have your dogs
with you... and coming such a long way I didn"t want to coop
them up in your car while we discussed matters."

"That's very generous, thank you!" I gestured sheepishly
at myself, "As you can tell, though, they do drool and shed...
they"ll likely make a mess." I turned toward the building,
which had a two-story brick facade. There were two plate glass
windows with open shutters flanking the door. For some reason
it looked quite rustic to me, like a wild west saloon out of
brick instead of wood. "Your office looks lovely, I"d hate to
mess it up."


"Nonsense. I insist."

"Tell you what... hold off on that decision until you"ve
met them."


"Fair enough."

With that I turned and stepped toward the truck. The
truck bounced and shifted and Fezzik's nose appeared in the
small gap at the top of the window.


"Oh, my." Richard said from behind me, voice subdued.


"Exactly." I put my hand on the door and said, "Ready?"


"I... suppose I must be."

I put my hand up to the window and made the gesture for
stay. Fezzik's nose disappeared and I opened the door.

"My goodness." Richard whispered, gazing wide-eyed at
Fezzik's massive frame filling the doorway. Fezzik glanced at
me and I smiled and nodded. He relaxed slightly and turned his
attention back to Richard. I picked up Fezzik's chain, found
the leather grip, and turned back to Richard.



'so, Richard... still okay?"


"Oh my yes... well... you said big, but... goodness me."

"English Mastiff's are the worlds gentlest giants. This
is Fezzik... and he's going to be one of the really giant ones."


"Uh... going to be?"

"He's a puppy. A little over six months... so a little less
that half-grown."

Fezzik watched us as we spoke, head turning to gaze at
whomever was speaking. He seemed relaxed, which surprised me a
little.


"He seems very attentive."

"That's Fezzik. He's the careful one." As if on command
Frank squeezed his head around Fezzik and smiled at Richard.
"And that's Frank..." words failed me as I tried to summarize
Frank, so instead I cleared my throat and said, 'so, Richard...
would you like to meet them? Be warned, they drool and you"ll
likely have to have your suit cleaned."

Richard straightened, adjusted his jacket and tie, and
smiled. "I would be honored."

I made the gesture for greet and Fezzik climbed out of
the truck. Frank jumped out, stumbled slightly, and turned his
stumble into is "happy to meet you" dance.

"Oh how wonderful!" Richard laughed and Frank danced up
to him, nearly knocking him down as he spun around for a butt
scratch. Richard knelt and gave proper homage to my loving
goofball, who responded in kind... without as many of his
slobbery kisses, as if he understood that restraint was
needed.

"Looks like you"ve made a friend. Why don"t you take his
leash and we"ll get to that stroll."


"Love to." Richard laughed and stood. He pulled out a
handkerchief, looked at it, shook his head and put it away.
"Come here, Frank."

Frank turned and sat, gazing up at Richard with his
soulful, loving eyes. Richard paused and stared back.

"Oh... my." Richard whispered and turned to me, eyes wide.
"He's... magical."


"Yeah... he is."

Richard took up Frank's leash and we turned and strolled
down Main street. We chatted about nothing in particular,
getting to know each other a bit better, and Richard pointed
out some highlights along the street. He was a history buff
and obviously very proud of Presque Isle.

At one point Fezzik stepped close to Richard and put his
head under Richard's hand. Richard paused and patted Fezzik.

"Oh, so sorry my friend... I didn"t greet you, did I."
Richard scratched behind Fezzik's ear and asked, "What
happened to his head and neck?"

"People." I said. "Don"t know how he cut his head, but on
his neck... those are scars from severe rope burns."

Richard sighed and shook his head. Peering closer to
Fezzik's scars he asked, "Does it hurt him?"

"He doesn"t like having his neck scratched, and he
doesn"t allow for collars, but the scar on his head doesn"t
seem to bother him. In fact, it itches him sometimes..."

"Oh? Well then..." Richard gently shifted his hand and
scratched around the scar between Fezzik's ear. Fezzik let out
a groan and started thumping his leg.


"Looks like you got the spot."

Richard continued for a bit, and when he stopped Fezzik
stepped close and thumped his head against Richard's hip,


stepped close and thumped his head against Richard's hip,

nearly knocking him over. Richard laughed and Fezzik smiled up
at him, tail wagging.


"Wow, you"re two-for-two Richard... well done."

"They"re amazing beasts... amazing." He turned to me,
smiling, "I can just picture them at the Thatcher homestead."


"Yeah..." A small burst of sorrow bubbled up inside me.


"What's wrong?"

I cleared my throat. 'so... the reason I decided so
suddenly after all these years to take over the homestead... and
by the way, thank you for agreeing to see me on such short
notice. It must have been a surprise after all those years of
silence."

"No trouble at all... as I said, it is an honor to meet you
and help you with the proceedings... and you don"t need to
explain why the sudden change."

"I feel you deserve to know..." I stared down at Frank, who
was sitting next to Richard gazing at a store window. "Frank
has an incurable condition, and likely..." I choked up a bit and
had to clear my throat, "...likely won"t live out the year."

"Oh... I"m so, so sorry..." Richard scratched Frank behind
the ears. Frank smiled and leaned against him. "He's such a
gift."

"He really is. I felt, somehow, that he should spend his
final days at the homestead... it's always been a magical place
for me." I sniffed and nodded. "Of course he's so social I"m
going to need to find folks willing to visit, at least up
until he gets too sick. He loves to meet people."

"Well, if it's not too forward of me... I know my wife,
kids, and grandkids would simply love to meet him..." He gazed
down at Frank and smiled, "In fact I imagine we"ll soon have
far too many "Frank fans" knocking at your door if we"re not
careful."


"But the homestead is so remote." We turned and resumed



"But the homestead is so remote." We turned and resumed

out walk.

Richard chuckled. "It only seemed so because you"re a
city slicker." He winked as he continued, "It's only twenty-
five miles or so West of here along 163, through Ashland, and
then along Thatcher Road. A nice bicycle ride in good weather.
There's zoning laws and such prohibiting too much development...
you drive through miles and miles of forest which can make it
seem quite remote, but it's really not that far."


"Put it that way and it sounds like we"ll be neighbors."


"Precisely."

We walked along in silence for a time, past another shop
where I saw someone standing staring off into space near the
door. I recognized that look... they were LINC"d to someone.

'so, Richard, slight change of topic... I notice you use
LINC, and the stream is pretty strong here... is LINC as
ubiquitous here as down south?"

"Mostly... you really can"t do business without it these
days, so everyone here in Presque Isle and at the college are
LINC users. Out toward the homestead is a little different...
there are some holdouts who haven"t even accepted the old
Internet or cell phones, but most folks are at least LINC
aware, if that makes sense." He thought for a moment, "As for
the strength of the signal, well... it does fade quite a bit the
further you get from Presque Isle... until you get closer to the
larger cities, that is. The old zoning laws have prevented any
of the public lands being used for LINternet... uh... what are
those things called?"

"They"re called "nodes". Is there anything preventing me
from setting up a node on my property?"

He looked surprised, "Why, no, but... from what I hear it's
prohibitively expensive to install a node, which is another
reason there are so few nodes in these parts. The one we have
here was partly funded by the college. Why would you want to
put a node on your land?"


"Frank's treatment. I have some special equipment I use



"Frank's treatment. I have some special equipment I use

that lets me take care of him by myself... and unfortunately it
requires a solid LIN signal."

"Oh my... well... certainly you can do whatever you like on
your own property. You"d need to be mindful of the
environmental regulations, though. Unfortunately I am not well
versed in that regard, but I can certainly find out if you"d
like me to." He glanced down at Frank and nodded, "Yes, most
certainly I"d love to help."

We chatted and walked some more, and at some point during
the conversation we must have turned around, as when I looked
up we were approaching the office. "Oh! Here we are."

"Indeed so... and right on time for your appointment."
Richard smiled, "Pups okay?"


"More than... if you"re sure..."

"I wouldn"t have it any other way. Please..." He stepped up
and opened the door, releasing Frank's leash. Frank wandered
in, tail wagging, and did his "new place" dance while Richard
and I laughed and Fezzik stood guard.


# Reality Check

As we settled in around Richard's desk, which sat at the
back of the small office, Frank discovered the bin of toys,
and Fezzik investigated the ridiculously small dog beds.


'so... you leave your door unlocked?"


"That's Presque Isle."


"No crime at all?"

"Of course there's some crime... a little more each year it
seems." Richard sighed, "Things have changed a lot in recent
years. Growth is good... mostly... but it can awaken some
undesirable elements."

"Interesting choice of words. Most folks say "brings in
the bad elements"."

"Many people believe that newcomers bring crime with
them. The reality is there are some... factions... who use
violence as a way to get what they want. As our population
grows, these factions find more and more opportunities to
extend their power and sphere of control, particularly with
the less entrenched, connected newcomers. Let's see..." He
murmured into his LINC. After a brief pause he continued,
"Here we are... we had twenty or so assaults in the last year,
and one murder."

"That doesn"t seem like a lot. When I lived in New
Orleans, we had over 300 murders a year... and Portland had 3
last year."

"True, though the population in those cities is much
larger. Considering that Presque Isle has around nine thousand
people, even one murder is far too many."



"Yeah, I agree... so tell me about these "factions"."

"There are two areas that seem to attract the bad
elements. The first is logging " a key business here in the
North Maine Woods. A vast majority of the logging companies
are completely legitimate, even eco-friendly in the way they
do things, but there are some that are rumored to have
connections to organized crime, and one in particular that has
been engaged in numerous shady dealings. Nothing was ever
proven, of course, because the owner is very well connected,
but a decent percentage of incidents of property damage and
outright assaults have involved landowners who initially
refused access to their land and eventually capitulated... on
terms that strongly favored that logging company every time."


"Didn"t anyone investigate them?"

"Of course they did, but to this day no-one has ever
pressed charges or been willing to stand witness against the
loggers. To be honest, the investigations themselves seemed
haphazard at best..."

"Wow, that sucks." I shook my head, "Out of curiosity,
what's the company's name?"

Richard answered without having to look it up, "Keats"
Lumber Company. Sole proprietor, Terence Keats."


"Keats, huh... sounds familiar..."

"They"ve attempted to move in on the Thatcher homestead
multiple times over the decades."

"Right! I remember now... they were always the lowest of
the lowball offers. How did you manage to hold them off?"

"Ironclad contract established by Miss Thatcher and
supported by the court. Your family " the Thatcher family " is
recognized as the first family of these parts, and that is
something that even Keats can"t go against... at least not until
us old fogeys who know the Thatchers are out of the picture."


"Did you ever meet Miss Thatcher?"


"Oh yes! Had that pleasure several times, in fact. I was
a brand new lawyer, and the senior partner thought that she"d
be a great first client for me."

"I"m surprised she agreed. She never seemed to like
change very much."

"Oh, I can be quite charming when I want to be." Richard
winked and chuckled, "...though she seemed very keen on having
someone younger handle her estate." He sobered and added,
"Huh... I wonder..." He scratched his chin and looked at me, "It's
as if she knew it would take a while for you to be ready..."


'she was an amazing lady."


"Very true."

I thought for a moment and then said, "Getting back to
the "factions" problem, you said that they preyed on new and
unconnected folks, and that you were able to fend them off
because of the Thatcher name. That changes once I take charge,
doesn"t it?"

"Yes... some... though a lot of folk have long memories and
your great-great-grandaunt was something of a legend around
here, even for those who never met her. Most folks will
respect you a bit more just because you"re a Thatcher... or at
least give you the benefit of the doubt they"d never normally
give to someone from away."


I chuckled, "Maybe I should change my name."


"That would help, yes." Richard didn"t crack a smile.

"Wow... okay... I guess I"ll give that some serious thought
then. My middle name is Thatcher so maybe I"ll use that when I
introduce myself." I thought back through our conversation,
'so you said there were two trouble factions... what's the
second?"


"Hunters."


"Fuck." I covered my mouth, 'sorry..."



"No need to apologize. That's a very appropriate word..."

"Yeah, well... as a vet I saw the ravages of stupid people
with guns quite frequently. I guess it's like the loggers,
though... most folks are law-abiding, careful, kill what they
can use, respect the land... and others use hunting as an excuse
to exhibit the worst humanity has to offer."


"Delight in destruction and control."

"Exactly." I shook my head, "Do you know how many times I
had to recommend to farmers that they avoid using their
pastures during hunting season? Most couldn"t follow my
advice, accepting the loss of a few cows or sheep a year... One
enterprising gentleman took the time to paint "COW" and
"HORSE" in bright white lettering on both sides of every
animal, and he STILL lost two cows to stupid, drunken
hunters."

"They were probably illiterate, and, as you say...
inebriated."

"Yeah, that's probably right... or deliberately giving the
finger to the farmer in question." I sighed, "Okay, so I get
that there's a problem with hunters, but are they organized
enough to be called a "faction"?"

"In a word... yes. There are several hunting "clubs" up
here that are known for ignoring landowners... often taking
revenge on folks who involve the authorities."

"What kind of revenge?" I looked over at Fezzik, who had
managed to curl up small enough to fit on one of the dog beds.
The only evidence there was a bed under him was the slight
elevation of his upper body.

Richard followed my gaze and nodded, "You guessed it.
killing pets or livestock, destroying property... always at
night, almost always in a well executed hit-and-run operation.
The one murder I spoke of was a particularly vocal landowner
who tried to meet them head on... gun in hand..."


"Did they catch the perpetrators?"


"The ground was dry, they drove in, shot him, and drove
away... the police couldn"t get a unique tire track, apparently
the shell casings fell into the truck " or they stopped to
pick them up " so no evidence that could narrow the list of
suspects."

"Wow... really well organized, and suspicious... it seems
unlikely there"d be NO evidence. There must have been
something that the police could use. If there are just a few
"clubs" in question here... couldn"t they use forensics on the
bullets and check each known club member or something?"

"That does seem possible, yes." Richard watched me over
steepled hands.

"Ah... right... so they"re connected as well." Richard
nodded. "Let me guess... Keats again."

"I couldn"t say for certain, however... two of the three
clubs are run by known associates and employees of Keats"
operations. They are thugs, bullies... truly a bad element."

"All of this helps clarify Miss Thatcher's final words to
me... she made me promise three things " that I would never sell
the property, that I wouldn"t allow logging, and that I
wouldn"t allow hunting. You said you"ve been able to hold the
loggers at bay... but what about the hunters?"

Richard shook his head and frowned. "I"m afraid there's
not much we can do about that, short of having a constant
patrol around the property. That would be both impossible to
cover effectively given that it's six square miles of forest
and it would be prohibitively expensive to even try. The
estate, though not insubstantial, could not afford that for
very long."

"Hmmm... okay, so I can expect that they"ve been hunting
the land illegally... and they"re used to doing so so they"ll
likely believe it's their right to continue."


"Well said."


"One more reason to put a LINternet node on my property."



"Why is that?"

"One of the more recent advances is automated security
tied to LINternet... machine intelligence enhanced surveillance
cameras and drones. Some are even weaponized, but they"re not
available to the public."


"My goodness... it sounds expensive."

"It can be, but I may have a connection that can help. At
the very least we can inundate the local authorities with
clear, unequivocal evidence of trespassing. Many urban police
forces and businesses use these LINC systems, and the evidence
they capture is completely tamper-proof, backed up instantly
to a secure location. If they still don"t investigate... perhaps
I can go public..."

Richard gazed at me for a moment and then said in a soft
voice, "Tread very carefully, Mr. Adkins... this is a very
dangerous game you are contemplating."

"Please, call me Will... and I"m open to suggestions that
will allow me to keep my promise to my Miss Thatcher, and not
in a "best effort" kind of way." I shook my head. "No, I
intend to do whatever it takes to keep to the letter my
promise and keep my property safe."

Richard looked at Frank, who was snoring on his back,
legs in the air, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth to
rest on the floor. "I hope it works out... and again I"ll do
whatever I can to help..."

"Richard... I will not involve you in this in any way that
might endanger you or your family. I"ve lived through enough
dangerous situations to know that some folks will do anything
to get what they want."


"But""

"No, I mean it. I am "from away", which means folks
expect strange things from me. I"ll try to make myself helpful
" maybe some free veterinary care or something " to strengthen
my connections with my neighbors. That should help folks


my connections with my neighbors. That should help folks

accept me if I end up having to make waves." I held his gaze
and said, "I will NOT make you or your family a target in any
way."

Richard struggled with this and eventually let out a
sigh, shoulders relaxing. "Thank you... I will help however I
can, though, and... I really appreciate your thoughtful
consideration."


"You have a family to take care of, and I... don"t."

"You have them." Richard gestured at the pups. On cue,
Fezzik farted loudly in his sleep.

"Indeed I do." We both laughed and turned finally to the
matter at hand... the paperwork that would allow me to take full
ownership and control of the Thatcher Homestead.


# Offers and Counters


"Thank you, Richard, for everything."

"It's truly a pleasure to meet you, Will, and good luck!
I"ll do that research on the environmental regulations for
your LINternet node... shouldn"t take me more than a day." Frank
was sitting on Richard's foot, leaning heavily on him and
pinning him to the doorway. Richard idly scratched Frank's
head and held on to the door frame in order to stay upright.

"I appreciate it." I looked down at the old weathered
wooden box containing keys and copies of the documents I
signed. "You said I have a safety-deposit box at the bank?"

"Yes, though the bank's closed for the day. You"ll need
to make an appointment... I imagine they have paperwork for you
to sign as well."

"Is there any urgency in that now that I"ve taken
possession?"

"Not at all. We"ve signed all the title transfer
documents and your deed won"t likely be available to pick up
for a month or more. Taxes aren"t due for months. They"ll
continue to pay the electric, trash, and recycling bills until
someone tells them to stop. You"ll need to go there and sign
documents to get access to any of the money, of course."

I relaxed and smiled, "Of course, and thank you again.
You"ve made this not only very easy, but every pleasant as
well." I reached out my hand. "It's been a pleasure, Richard."

"Likewise." He smiled as we shook, holding my gaze, "Take
care, Will... and welcome home." As we let go Frank stood and
licked Richard's hand. Richard chuckled and scratched Frank's
head, adding, "You too, Frank... welcome home."


"Let's arrange a play date for your grandkids once I get
settled in. Frank will need company."


"Perfect! They"ll be so excited."

"Come on Frank." I led the dogs over to the truck, which
I unlocked with a murmur to my LINC, thankful for the "hands
free" help. When I opened the door, Frank bounded up and into
the back seat, obviously feeling fine. Fezzik stepped in, calm
and controlled, and immediately turned to sit between Frank
and the outside world.

I took off their harnesses, noticing much easier it was
from outside the truck. I closed the door and stepped around
the front, waving to Richard as I got into the driver's seat.
He smiled and waved back, turning to head back into his office
as we drove off.

The address of the homestead was "1 Thatcher Road", which
somehow made me feel important... I now owned the first house on
a road named after my family. I murmured this address into my
LINC, which chimed and started giving directions.

True to the magic of dogs everywhere, both pups slept
right up until we were about a mile or so from the property.
Somehow sensing we were getting close they both popped up and
glued their noses to the cracks at the top of the windows,
breathing deeply and noisily and once again drooling all over
the doors.

When I spotted the mailbox, I was gratified to see that
someone had gone to great lengths to keep everything trimmed
and neat. Even the mailbox looked freshly painted, with the
name "Thatcher" in gold letters on both sides.

I pulled into the drive, through the thick band of trees
blocking the view of the buildings, and the magical place from
my childhood unveiled before me.

About a hundred feet from the road the driveway passed
the large white farmhouse. Like the grounds and the mailbox it
looked very well maintained. I half expected Miss Thatcher to
come out of the white screen door and wave to us as she always
had " until the last visit, where she had been sitting on the


had " until the last visit, where she had been sitting on the

porch in the rocking chair.

Behind the house was an acre or so of fenced-in field.
The building with the still was beside the field, large doors
facing a gate in the fence.

The driveway branched thirty feet or so past the
farmhouse, with the left branch leading between the Still
House and the fence and the right branch continuing straight
to the barn.

The barn was also in perfect condition. The forest hadn"t
encroached at all on the field or buildings, and the lawn
looked freshly mown.

I felt myself relax at the sight of it all " I was
expecting to find everything run down and unlivable, but it
seemed that everything was more than just okay... it all looked
beautifully maintained.

"They must have paid someone..." I muttered, not
remembering anything about a maintenance company in the
paperwork Richard gave me. Then I remembered he said there
were no fees or costs other than taxes, electricity and trash,
and said, "Huh."

I pulled up the drive and stopped at a turnout in front
of the farmhouse, gazing around as I killed the engine. With a
growing sense of excitement I pulled out the paperwork started
reading, glancing around to identify the things I read about.

The paperwork had a lot of historical facts about the
property, thanks to Richard. I learned that the farmhouse
construction completed in 1814, making it the earliest
standing examples of Greek Revival architecture in the region.

The proper name of the land we were on was "Thatcher
Township", sold to "MC" Elijah Thatcher in 1810. I had to look
up what "MC" meant, as I was pretty sure it wasn"t like "DJ".
It turned out that "MC" stood for "Master Craftsman", and
after a little digging I discovered that Elijah Thatcher, born
in Massachusetts in 1781, was apparently both a master
carpenter and a distinguished architect. I bookmarked the
information to follow up later, and turned back the paperwork.


The land was part of the original subdivision of Northern
Maine which started in 1783, long before Maine became a
separate state. Thatcher Township was one of the very few
original "townships" left intact. Most of the other six-
square-mile subdivisions had been sold to the logging
industry, were owned by the government, or had been further
subdivided by their owners to serve their growing families.

The still, built in 1825, was the one of the first
distilleries on record to produce whiskey in northern Maine.
Maine became a prohibition state in 1851, but apparently
Elijah's grandson Tobias was given special permission to
continue distilling and selling their whiskey to "parties
abroad"... meaning across the boarder into Quebec and Montreal.


"Tobias... I wonder if Toby knows."

Frank whined at the sound of my voice. I turned and he
scratched at the door.

"Right... sorry boys. Got caught up... let's get out there
and check it out."

They both stood up and Frank reached over and licked my
face.

I got out and was immediately struck by the smell. Pine
forests have a distinct odor, and the smell brought me right
back to my childhood. I took a deep breath, smiled and opened
the back door to the truck... releasing the hounds.

As we stepped out onto the lawn a black Lincoln town car
swerved into the driveway and rolled to a stop some distance
away. A pickup zoomed and skidded to a halt behind the car. As
the dust settled the pickup's doors opened, disgorging two men
in hunting gear sporting very fancy-looking rifles. They
walked up to the town car and one of the men opened the left
rear door.

A man in an expensive-looking black suit stepped out of
the car, nodded to the man holding the door, and walked to the
front of the limo.


Both dogs froze and stared, one on either side of me, and
Fezzik started growling, low in his throat. As soon as I saw
the rifles I set my LINC to record, using that special
security mode I learned about a year or so ago. The connection
was bad, but it would store a local copy until I got to a
better location, and the security mode would make it
admissible in court.

The man in the suit stopped ten feet in front of the
limo, brushed himself off and then put his fingers to his lips
and whistled. The pickup started bouncing, and the largest
man I have ever seen pushed himself up from the bed of the
truck and swung over the side. He was so large that when he
pushed off I swear the truck slid sideways an inch or so.

Fezzik's growl got a little louder and he lowered his
head. Frank stepped closer to me, and to my great surprise, he
started growling as well.

I couldn"t take my eyes off the huge man... there was
something wrong about him. I felt a brief stab of pain and was
suddenly reminded of the strange patterns I saw in the barn as
a child. Somehow reliving that moment, I closed my eyes, drew
a deep breath, and tried to relax and just let him be what he
was. When I opened my eyes his form blurred slightly and then
changed.

He was not Human. He looked like an Ogre from fairy
tales, complete with fangs, thick gray skin, and more muscles
than Hercules. He moved with surprising grace despite his
massive eight-foot-tall frame.

"Welcome to the neighborhood Mr. Adkins." The man in the
suit called out, his voice deep and authoritative, as his
armed companions stepped up behind him.


"Uh... thank you. You have me at a disadvantage..."

"You got that right." One of the riflemen said and the
other one laughed.


"Boys, please, a little respect."


'sorry boss." They answered in unison.


"Well then, my name is Keats. Terence Keats. Perhaps
you"ve heard of me?"

"Yes sir, I have." During this exchange the Ogre, who
was walking slowly toward Mr. Keats, stopped in mid stride,
eyes wide and staring at Fezzik. Fezzik and Frank continued to
growl at the Humans and Fezzik's hackles went up.

"Good, then that will save us some time." Keats frowned
at Fezzik. "You mind shuttin" those dogs up?"


"You mind puttin" down your guns?"

Keats looked surprised at my response and turned to the
men behind him. "Boys? What do you think?"

"Nah." The one who spoke earlier answered. The other one
just spat on the ground.

"Didn"t think so." Keats turned back and shrugged.
"Answer's no."


"Then that's my answer as well. Fair is fair."

'suit yourself." Keats paused and collected his thoughts,
"Now Mr. Adkins... I"m here out of respect for your dear
departed... what was she, your great-grandmother? Miss
Thatcher?"

"Great Aunt." I didn"t bother to be accurate... I knew he
didn"t care.

"Right. I"m here out of respect for her, telling you in
person the way things are going to go."


"And that is?"

"Your going to pack up, turn around, and drive back to
wherever you came from. Then you"re going to sell me this
property for... say... one hundred thousand dollars... and that will
be that."



"One hundred thousand?"


"Again, out of respect for your""

"That's an insultingly low offer, Mr. Keats, and even if
it were ten times that the answer would still be no."

Keats stared at me, brow furrowed, and then said, "Did
you just... interrupt me, boy?"

_Did he seriously just call me "boy"?_ I was easily ten
years older than Keats.

"Yeah, I did. Because I have heard of you, and because
Miss Thatcher warned me about folk like you."

"Right..." He stared me in the eyes and I stared right
back, breathing slowly and evenly. I"d played this game
before, I knew the stakes, and I HATED bullies. Fezzik's growl
grew louder.

Without breaking eye contact I asked, 'so if you"re here
out of respect, then why the guns?"

"Oh, my boys are just going to do a little hunting...
figured since we"re here and all."


"No, they"re not."

"Beg your pardon?" Keats" expression darkened and he
shook his head as if he couldn"t believe his ears.

"No, this property is off limits to hunters, loggers...
anyone who isn"t me or a guest of mine."

"Boy..." He stepped forward, lowering his head and
clenching his fists. His armed cronies readied their guns and
the ogre stepped up behind them. The ogre was still staring
wide-eyed at Fezzik. "You"re making a very, very big mistake,
boy."

"No, I"m not. This is my land now, and I honor the last
wishes of Miss Thatcher when I say you will never own this


wishes of Miss Thatcher when I say you will never own this

land, log this land, or hunt this land."


"You"ve gone too far, boy... and SHUT those DOGS UP!"


"No."

"Fine." Keats turned and gestured toward Fezzik and
Frank. 'shoot the dogs."


"Right boss!" They cocked their rifles and raised them...

...the ogre moved so fast he was a blur. One second the men
were taking aim, and the next the man on the left flew back
against the town car, hitting it with bone-crunching force,
his gun discharging into the air as it sailed out of his
hands. The ogre grabbed the other man's gun and wrapped it's
barrel around the man's arms. I could hear the bones breaking
from 20 feet away. With a flick of his wrist the ogre sent the
second man flying into the air to land hard, screaming and
rolling across the graveled drive.

"WHAT THE"" Keat's shout was cut off as the ogre grabbed
him by his head with one hand and picked him up.

The entire time, the ogre's eyes barely moved from
Fezzik.

As Keats shouted and struggled, trying to hold himself up
by grabbing the ogre's massive wrist in both hands, Fezzik and
Frank both stopped growling and sat. For the first time, the
ogre looked away from Fezzik...


...and fixed his stare on me.

"Thank you." This entire situation was so surreal. I felt
remarkably calm, though I had to raise my voice to be heard
above the men's shouts and screams. "You should put him down
now."

"Him?" The ogre pointed at Keats with his other hand.
"Not kill?"


"No... let him go..."



"He bad."

"Yeah, I know... and he"ll probably come after you now too,
so..." I turned to Fezzik and said, "What do you think, Fezzik...
is the big man a friend?"

"Friend" was one of the words I used in training. Fezzik
barked once and stood, wagging at the ogre.

The ogre's eyes went wide and he smiled, tossing Keats
casually onto the town car, knocking the wind out of him and
denting the hood.

The driver door opened and another man got out of the
limo. He was dressed as a chauffeur and quite obviously
scared.

Oblivious to the new man, Fezzik bounded forward and the
ogre strode up to meet him, kneeling and laughing as Fezzik
jumped up and licked his face. As this was going on, the
chauffeur hurried around the front of the limo to check on
Keats.


"Excuse me..."


The man froze and turned to stare at me.

"I"m sorry it turned out this way. I"m sure it won"t make
a difference, but do me a favor... remind Mr. Keats that he
escaped today with his life because of me and my dogs. I"d
apologize to him but... this is really his own doing."


"Uh... yeah... sure..."

I gestured at the two gunmen. "How do you suggest we deal
with them? They"re going to need medical attention... Mr. Keats
as well..."

The one who hit the car was stirring. The other one was
unconscious, his shattered arms bleeding.


"I"ll get them to the hospital."



"Good man. Do you need some help?"

He glanced nervously at the ogre, who was still on his
knees playing with Fezzik. The chauffeur looked around and saw
that the first gunman was stirring and groaning, "No... I got
this."


"Thank you."

When the chauffeur tried to help him Keats cried out,
clutching his neck and wincing. I thought about telling them
not to move Keats, as he may have potentially serious injuries
to his neck, but after that initial response Keats seemed able
to move without too much pain.

Meanwhile, the first gunman staggered to his feet,
holding his head and looking dazed. He recovered quickly,
glaring at me and giving Fezzik and the Ogre a wide berth as
he limped over to help the chauffeur. Together they put Keats
in the back seat of the limo.

I glanced over at Fezzik and the Ogre. It was amazing to
see how gentle the Ogre was... and how joyous Fezzik seemed to
be. It was as if Fezzik finally had someone big enough to play
with... someone he didn"t have to worry about hurting.

I went back and forth between watching them play and
keeping an eye on the men. The gunman and the chauffeur
carried their unconscious comrade to the truck and laid him
gently in the back. The gunman then got into his truck and sat
there, holding his head.

As the chauffeur got ready to leave I said, "Hey... can I
ask you something?"


'sure, I guess."


"Why do you work for Keats?"

"Only show in town..." The man shrugged, "He pays pretty
good."


"I expect he"ll come after me now."


The man shook his head and said, "You got that right...
but..." he met my gaze and smiled, lowering his voice, "Good on
you."


"I might suggest you find another job..."


"Yeah."


"Thanks again for your help."

"Yeah..." The chauffeur got into the car. As he did so the
driver door of the pickup opened and the gunman got out. He
limped over to the far side of the drive and started looking
around.

I pointed at where I saw his gun land. "I think it's over
there by that stump."

He looked up, glowered at me, winced, and headed to where
I pointed, rubbing his shoulder. After some searching he found
his gun and hurried back to his truck. Without another glance
at me he got in, backed the pickup slowly out of the drive,
and drove off. The town car followed, both vehicles traveling
at a much more sedate speed than when they had arrived.

"Well... that was interesting." Frank looked up at me and
tilted his head. "We"ve just landed in the middle of a real
sticky mess, Frank..."

Frank whined and pawed at the ground, glancing at where
the ogre was on his back laughing hysterically with Fezzik
jumping on his head.

"Yeah go on... meet our new friend." I made the "free to
go" gesture and Frank bounded up and joined in the fun.

I watched them and wondered what the second hour at the
homestead would bring.


# From Legends

"Ahem." A soft male voice sounded from behind me. "Please
don"t be alarmed... I mean no harm... quite the opposite in fact."
His accent had that strange almost-British way that older
Mainers sometimes have.

I turned around to see a Faun standing at the top of the
porch steps. He stood about five foot three, with foxlike
features and reddish-brown fur covering his head and body. He
wore dark gray pinstriped slacks that stopped just below his
knees and a matching vest over a sharply-pressed, pristine
white shirt. His cloven feet were bare and he had small black
horns between his tall, pointed ears.


"Why would I be alarmed?"

"Well... I"m sure you were expecting the homestead to be
empty... in fact I was going to approach you more carefully, but
current circumstances warrant that I introduce myself a bit
sooner than anticipated." He adjusted his vest, and I noticed
a fine silver chain connecting one of the buttons to something
in his pocket.


"Classic." I smiled.


"Um... excuse me?"

"That's a pocket watch, isn"t it? You are the perfect
image of the classic Faun from literature."

"Uh... beg your pardon?" His eyes grew wide and he brought
his hand up to his chin, toying with his tiny beard. "What did
you say?"

"I"m sorry... I didn"t mean to offend you, sir..." I shook my
head, "I spoke out of turn."


"Oh no! No... please don"t apologize. It's just that..." He
once again adjusted his vest and straightened, shaking his
head. "I must be slipping... you aren"t supposed to see me as I
truly am."


"No? What am I supposed to see?"


"A dapper, if somewhat diminutive gentleman."

"Well, that is what you look like. I like your vest, by
the way."

"Oh well, I..." He looked down and blushed, "Thank you. But
I really meant... Human gentleman."


"The horns give you away... and the fur."

"Again, you were not supposed to see them. I attempted to
apply what is called a "glamor", which lets me appear to be
what a human might expect to see. It's quite a simple ruse,
really, if you don"t try to change your appearance too
drastically."

"Oh, right, well... I figure the Ogre probably broke that
spell."


"The..." His eyes went wide. "Oh my, you know what he is?"


"Absolutely."


"And you"re not afraid?"

"Yeah, I am, a little, especially seeing how powerful and
amazingly fast he is... but as you can see..." I turned and
gestured to where the ogre lay with both huge dogs draped
across him. "He seems to be somewhat enamored of my dogs,
which puts him in the category of "good enough for me"."

"I must admit he does seem quite happy... happier than I"ve
ever seen him, in fact."


'so you know him?"


"Oh yes. He comes from... well... let's just say he spent
many years here on the property."


"What was he doing with Keats?"

"They found him when they were here hunting a few years
back. Took him by surprise, which is in and of itself quite a
feat. Apparently his glamor worked on them, because they just
thought they found a large wild man... and they gave him quite a
lot of beer, which he"d never had before."


'so he followed them home?"

"As I understand it, yes, more out of curiosity than
anything else." The faun straightened, "You see, Ogres are
followers... they"re most comfortable with a strong leader, and
for whatever else you might say about Mr. Keats, he is a
strong leader. Our friend there had been without a leader for
quite some time... so he gravitated to Keats despite the man's
despicable nature."

We watched the ogre lazily petting Fezzik, who was draped
across his chest. As we watched his petting slowed and he
started snoring, his arm falling to his side.

I shuddered as I imagined some of the things Keats likely
had him do.

To take my mind off that train of thought I turned back
to the Faun, stepped up to the bottom of the steps, and held
out my hand. "By the way, I"m Will."

"Oh goodness me where are my manners?" He stepped forward
hurriedly and grasped two of my fingers, bowing slightly as he
said, "I am Tumnus."

"Is that your real name? Sorry if that's rude, but Tumnus
is a pretty famous character from a book."

"Actually... no. Miss Thatcher gave it to me, as my real
name is unpronounceable to humans."


"Tumnus it is, then... much better than me mangling your



"Tumnus it is, then... much better than me mangling your

name and insulting you any more than I already have."

Tumnus looked at me for a moment and then smiled. "Master
William... I have a very good feeling about you. I think we"re
going to get along famously."

"Likewise, Mr. Tumnus." We shared a smile, and as it
started to get awkward I asked, 'so... how long have you been at
the farm?"

"Oh, let me see... I came here in your year 2000 AD.
Springtime..." He smiled and stared off into space. "It was
quite lovely... and please, it's just "Tumnus"."


'so you"ve been here over seventy years? Wow."

"When you put it like that it does sound like a long
time."


"How did you get here?"

Tumnus peered at me for a moment and then shook his head,
"If you"ll forgive me, that is probably best left for a later
time... suffice it to say Miss Thatcher invited me here to help
out with the property."

I looked around at the pristine buildings, 'so you"re the
one who's been maintaining things?"


"Indeed I am. With some help, of course."


"Wow, again... that must take a lot of work."

"Nothing too strenuous, I assure you." He smiled, "I
enjoy keeping things in order... and it gives me... or rather it
gave me great pleasure to work for Miss Thatcher."

"Thank you, for doing such a magnificent job... and for
taking such good care of her."

"You are most welcome, sir." He bowed again and then
straightened, glancing out at the sleeping giants, "Now,
before they awaken, we should discuss how best to support


before they awaken, we should discuss how best to support

Moose and the others."


"Moose? Is that his name?"

"Yes... he chose it for himself. A flash of inspiration, I
thought."


"And who are these "others"?"

"Did I say that? ...oh dear, yes I did." He cleared his
throat and straightened his vest. "There are three others on
the property... all of whom keep pretty much to themselves, even
old Hylonome... she takes care of the still, brewing special
concoctions to keep us healthy... she doesn"t like to be
disturbed when she works, or when she's not working... Hmmm...."
He stared off into space, toying with his beard.

"I"d like to meet them... on their own time, of course. I
know change can be scary, and it"ll take me some time to
settle in, so there's no rush at all unless I can be of help."


"Of course, and thank you for being so considerate."

I stared at Frank, draped across Moose's legs. "Tumnus, I
will have to make one fairly big change, though, and quite
soon..."


"Oh? What's that?"

"I will need to put up what's called a LINternet node...
its a technical, uh, system that will let me connect with the
world." I gestured toward the giants, "I need it to take care
of Frank, the smaller of my dogs."

"Well... I"m sure you know what you"re doing..." He looked
doubtful. "I certainly can"t stop you, regardless, as it's
your land." He hesitated and then said, "Can you tell me more
about it? What does it look like? How big is it?"

"Actually, I don"t know the answers to that... they come in
many variations. I"ll have to consult with Toby " my brother "
to find out more."



"Ah yes, Master Tobias..."


"You know him?"

"I know OF him, certainly. Miss Thatcher spoke fondly of
both of you, though you were certainly her favorite."


"Why is that?"


"Well, I should think that would be obvious..."


"Not to me."

"Think about what we discussed when we first met... the
fact that you saw right through my glamor and the one I put on
Moose... that in and of itself sets you apart from pretty much
all other Humans." He peered at me and lowered his voice, "You
have the Sight, and likely other skills that make you uniquely
suited to continue Miss Thatcher's work." He sighed, 'she
waited for you for a very long time. Several generations, in
fact."


"What would she have done if I didn"t have this Sight?"

"I don"t know." Tumnus shrugged, 'she would probably
still be here, sitting, waiting... but she was mostly human so
she might not have lived too much longer, even with Hylonome's
help."


"When did Hylonome get here?"

'shortly after I did... she was the second of us that Miss
Thatcher invited here, shortly before Miss Thatcher died."


"Why did you come?"

He gazed at me for a moment and then shook his head.
"It's a long, sad, complicated story... and it's tied to some
very emotionally difficult things. If you"ll forgive me and be
patient, I believe you will soon come to understand."

"Okay... it doesn"t really matter I guess. You"re here, and
you"re helping in some very real ways, so I am grateful." I


you"re helping in some very real ways, so I am grateful." I

chuckled. "No looking a gift horse in the mouth."

"I am unfamiliar with that phrase... it sounds... messy." He
shivered.

"It means that I"ve been given a gift " you and the
others " and though there may be strings attached I should
always be grateful for what I have."

"Ah... a very good saying indeed!" He smiled, "I like it...
"gift horse"." His eyes twinkled and he added, "Particularly
appropriate in Hylonome's case..."


"Why is that?"

'she's a Centauress... a very wise one indeed... if a bit
ornery."

"Wow..." I stared at Tumnus. "I... this is really amazing.
It's like I"ve woken up in a fairy tale."


"Perhaps you have... and this chapter is just beginning."


# Purpose

As we finished unloading the truck, Tumnus asked, "Master
William, would you be willing to meet with the Lady? She will
expect you to say hello."


"The Lady?"

"You"ve met her before... in the barn? You made quite an
impression."

"I don"t remember it..." Tumnus gestured toward the barn
and I nodded as I added, "I have a strong feeling of something
wonderful happening and a vague memory of lights and voices.
It was a long time ago."


"Indeed it was. Do you have the key?"

I looked around and spotted the old worn box Richard had
given me. I picked up the keyring and held it up, "Which one
is it?"

Tumnus frowned, "I"m sorry, Master William... I can never
remember."

"That's fine. We"ll figure that out when we get to the
barn. Let's go." Tumnus nodded and followed me out of the
farmhouse. As we neared the barn I was struck once again with
how well made and well maintained it was. After a bit of trial
and error I finally found the key and the padlock sprang open
as I unlocked it. "You"ve even oiled this padlock? You"re
amazing, Tumnus."

"Thank you, Master William." He smiled and adjusted his
vest. "It is a pleasure to serve."


With some trepidation I slid the bolt and pushed the door



With some trepidation I slid the bolt and pushed the door

open. The barn was precisely how I remembered it " shafts of
sunlight illuminating the interior from the skylights in the
curved roof overhead. The light glinted off copper caps and
veins in the beams and columns and highlighted the silver-and-
copper patterns on the floor at either end of the barn.

The air smelled dry and dusty. Motes danced and swirled
through the shafts of sunlight, propelled by the slight breeze
caused when I opened the door. My head swam for a moment,
caught up in the whirling motion, and a tinge of a headache
blossomed in my temples.

I closed my eyes, remembering Miss Thatcher's words, and
once again breathed and let go, unfocusing my mind and letting
things just be what they are. After a few breaths I could feel
my shoulders relaxing and the headache faded away.

_Welcome back, William Thatcher._ In my meditative state it
felt perfectly natural to have a soft, distant voice speak in
my mind. _We have much work to do._


"What do you mean?" I whispered.

"Excuse me?" Tumnus said. His voice startled me and I
opened my eyes. The room was a blur at first, with the glow
from the patterns on the floor dominating my view. My mind
started sorting things out and within a moment my vision
cleared.


'sorry, I wasn"t speaking to you."


"You... weren"t?" Tumnus whispered, "That means..."

"The Lady greeted me and said..." I frowned and shook my
head, "...she said something about work... Strange."

"Amazing." He breathed, eyes wide. "Well... I"ll leave you
to it, then... I"m sure you have much to talk about."

"Tumnus, what's going on? Why can"t I remember what she
just said to me?"


"I"m sure I don"t know. If I were to hazard a guess,



"I"m sure I don"t know. If I were to hazard a guess,

though, I"d say it has something to do with state of mind."


"What do you mean?"

"The Lady..." He paused and pulled at his beard. "It's hard
to explain. She's very real, but she is elsewhere. Perhaps you
can think of it as the difference between dreaming and being
awake."


"Yeah, that makes sense. It feels like I just woke up."


"Do you often remember your dreams?"

'sometimes, but it's always fragments at best. I dream a
lot, though... much more than Toby or my friends." I smiled at
Tumnus, "Thank you, Tumnus. That analogy helps quite a bit."

"My pleasure, Master William." He turned and put his hand
on the door. "Now if you will excuse me, I have some chores to
attend to... and I think you have some dreaming to do."

"Yes I do... thank you Tumnus. Oh, and please keep an eye
on our friendly giants, will you? I may be a while."

"With pleasure, sir." He bowed and stepped out, shutting
the door behind him.

I looked around the barn. Hay bales and bags of grain
rested on pallets at the far end against one wall, just as
they had when I was last here. I walked toward the stalls,
taking in the details, and noting how solid and clean
everything was. It wasn"t even as dusty as one might expect
for such an old structure.

The floor at either end and in the aisle between the
stalls was stone. There were no scuff marks or other signs
that anything had ever walked across it, which felt a little
strange. The stalls were easily large enough for horses, but
if a horse had walked across the floor it would have left some
kind of mark.

I stepped up the the first stall on the right and slid
open the gate. The stall had a dirt floor, which surprised me.
The stone floor stopped at the door, and wherever any wood


The stone floor stopped at the door, and wherever any wood

came close to the dirt " the base of the wall and the
supporting columns " it was covered with copper. Thin lines of
copper ran up from the copper coverings at the base of the
columns and along the walls of the stall. These lines linked
to similar copper lines in the stone... which in turn connected
to the patterns at either end of the barn.

It looked like a very complicated circuit diagram. I
wondered why they went to so much trouble.

Since I had no answer to this conundrum I turned back to
investigating the stall. The dirt was perhaps an half inch
lower than the stone floor. I got the impression that the
stone and copper-covered wooden elements sunk into the dirt a
good distance.

As I took this in I had a flash of memory. When I was
last here Miss Thatcher took me to the center stall on the
right. The memory faded as quickly as it arrived.

"Well then..." I stepped back and closed the stall door,
making sure I slid the bar to secure it, and stepped over to
the center stall. I took a deep breath, tried to relax my
mind, and opened the stall door.

A small four-legged stool with copper-bottomed legs
rested on the dirt in the center of the stall. An old
hurricane lantern and an ancient box of matches sat on the
stool.

There was a slight depression in the dirt under the
stool, a circle the size and shape of the base of the lantern.

I continued to breathe slowly and let go of my thoughts
and questions as I move the stool a few feet from the center.
I placed the lantern as precisely as I could on the
indentation in the center, and then stepped back and sat on
the stool.

I took a moment to investigate the box of matches. It had
a faded label with what looked like an old oil tank and the
words 'solomon and Sons Plumbing & Heating, est. 1988." Inside
the box were seven ancient well-preserved wooden matches.


I closed the box and sat for a time, eyes closed,
meditating and trying to open my mind to whatever was going to
happen. I felt... something... in the air, like the feeling you
get when there's about to be a tremendous electrical storm "
heavy, almost foreboding, but promising release.


The Lamp, if you will.

"Of course." I whispered, struggling to remain open and
thought-free. I slid forward and knelt beside the lamp, pulled
out a match, took a breath, and struck it on the side of the
box.

The match flared vigorously and I quickly lit the
lantern, expecting the old, dry wood to burn very fast. The
lamp lit immediately and the match went out. I closed the
little window and the lamp flame stabilized, white smoke
drifting up through the vents.

I shifted back onto the stool, noticing that the match
was unburned.


'seven." I whispered and put the match back in the box.

_Ah... yes._ The voice in my head was louder. _Give me a
moment. It's been a while._

"Of course... take your time, please." I settled in,
placing the matches in my shirt pocket, and closed my eyes.

After a while I felt something shift and opened my eyes
to see that the white smoke had coalesced into a vaguely
humanoid shape " small, but definitely feminine.

"My Lady." I said, surprising myself with my choice of
words.

"My Champion." She replied, her voice soft and distant.
"We don"t have much time... even with the Flame and the Weave
this takes quite a bit of effort."

"Please tell me how I can help... and if you have time...
perhaps you can help me understand why I am your champion?"


"You one of my chosen keepers " the keepers of the gates.
My world... indeed my entire plane of existence... is dying.
Something is draining the magic and destroying the
environment. My sister has taken advantage of my weakened
state and has usurped my throne, imprisoning me, enslaving my
people, and destroying what little was left of my court."


"My Lady! I"m so sorry... but how can I help?"

"Many seasons ago I found some humans, such as Sarah
Thatcher and yourself, with more than a little Fae blood in
them. With their help I"ve established a few gates into this
world. Initially I wanted to re-establish the bridges that
once existed between your world and mine... to seek peaceful
ways to learn and grow with each other as we once did." She
sighed. "...but now my need is much greater... indeed we are
desperate. It is my hope that you and the other Fae-touched
will help my people escape enslavement and make their future
here... on Earth."


"I... of course I will help... but..."

"I fear I can"t keep this connection going much longer.
You will remember this conversation. I will work to establish
an escape route to this gate. Please... help my people." Her
voice began to fade and the ghostly image started to disperse.

"Of course! But how? I don"t know the first thing about
the Fae..."

"Yes you do." Her voice was barely a whisper, then she
switched back to speaking directly into my mind, _You have
already accepted Moose and Tumnus. The four who are here will
guide you... that is their purpose and their destiny... though you
must help them find their way._

"I think I understand. I will try, but..." I sighed and
added, "I will do my best."

She didn"t respond. I was about to stand when her voice
whispered in my mind's ear.



Thank you.

I sat for a time staring at the steady lantern flame,
then I stood, put out the lantern, and returned the stool,
lantern, and matches to their original position.

My mind swirled with questions. The conversation felt
distant, unreal... like one of those few dreams I recall
clearly... but true to her word I could remember all of it.

As I exited the stall and locked it I realized that I had
really did have a choice. I could choose to let this dream
fade, as my rational mind broke it down logically and started
questioning everything. That seemed like the sensible thing to
do.


My heart, however, knew the truth.

I double-checked that everything was back in it's proper
place and headed out of the barn, bolting and padlocking the
door.

A cool breeze sighed through the trees, the late
afternoon sun casting shadows that danced across the lawn.
Everything had that surreal, intense clarity that sometimes
happens when I am focused and in the moment.

Moose and Fezzik were sitting facing each other in the
grass, looking for all the world as if they were having an
intense conversation. Tumnus was sweeping the porch and Frank
lay at the far end next to the rocking chair, watching the
world. Frank spotted me, jumped up, tail wagging furiously,
bounded across the porch and down the stairs, nearly knocking
poor Tumnus over in the process.

I smiled and watched Frank run toward me, jowls and ears
flapping wildly. There's nothing quite like watching a Mastiff
run toward you " an amalgamation of gravity, loose skin, and
pure joy.

As I watched I realized that there really was no choice
if I was to remain true to myself. My shoulders and face
relaxed as my thoughts and heart aligned, releasing the
tension I wasn"t even aware I was holding.


I felt I needed to say something, so I closed my eyes and
whispered, "Thy will be done, My Lady."

The breeze shifted and I felt the warmth of the late
afternoon sun on my face.


Then Frank collided with me and we both went sprawling...


# Rituals

Later that evening I sat at the kitchen table while
Tumnus finished preparing dinner. Frank and Fezzik were
snoring away on the rug in the living room, which was adjacent
to the kitchen and separated by a long counter with open
doorways at either end.

"Bon apetit!" Tumnus said, placing a steaming bowl of
fragrant stew in front of me.


"Tumnus... you shouldn"t have. This looks amazing!"

"How better to welcome you home, Master William... and
please, it is no trouble. I take great pleasure in serving
you, and I enjoy cooking."

"But you do so much! I mean... you do everything." I looked
up at him and he smiled and shook his head.

"It is good to have a..." His voice trailed off and he
shook his head.


"What is it?"

"I was going to say "family again" but I realized that
was presumptuous of me."

I gazed at him for a moment and then set down my spoon.
"Tumnus... I can think of no better person to have as part of my
family."


"Master William! That's... that's so kind of you."

I took a deep breath and let my feelings of gratitude
fill my mind. As I breathed out I imagined embracing Tumnus
and welcoming him into my family.


Tumnus" eyes widened and he staggered, grasping the back
of a chair to steady himself. "Master William..." he whispered,
"...how in the world did you do that?"


"I just did what felt right. Why? What did I do?"

"You..." he cleared his throat and straightened, adjusting
his vest. "You invoked a ritual... just naturally, without all
the preparation and fuss." He shook his head, "I have never,
in all my years, heard of such a thing, especially from a
Human."


"A ritual? What do you mean?"

"You recall I spoke of casting a glamor? That's invoked
through a ritual... it normally takes years of training and
focus to learn how to do even the simplest of them. I am
moderately good at the few rituals I know, most of which
involving cleaning and maintenance." He gestured around the
room, "When I said that all this work wasn"t really too much
of a burden, I meant it. I do much of it through rituals."

'so... you work magic... but you said I did a ritual just
then?"


"Yes, one of the more complex ones."


"What did I do?"


"Please, eat. I don"t want your food to get cold."


"Join me."


He looked startled, "Uh... what?"

"Please, join me. I would love to have the company... and
you can help me understand what I did as we eat."


"Well... it is most unusual..." He looked uncomfortable.

"It's not an order, Tumnus... it's a request... from a
friend." I shook my head, "Please don"t if it makes you


friend." I shook my head, "Please don"t if it makes you

uncomfortable."

"Oh, well... if you put it that way..." He adjusted his vest
and smiled, "I accept your gracious offer."


"Good."

I watched as he prepared another bowl and spent some time
trying to figure out where to sit. At one point he looked at
me, holding his bowl, his ears down... he looked sad and lost. I
smiled and pointed to the seat at the end of the table to my
right and he brightened, sat, and then immediately jumped up
and ran into the other room.


"Uh..."

A moment later he returned with a pillow and a small pile
of books, which he used to elevate himself so he could sit
comfortably at the table.


"Thank you for joining me. Now... what are we eating?"

"A vegetarian stew... an old family recipe. Made from
natural herbs, mushrooms, roots, and other gifts from the
forest."


I dug in. "Wow, this is amazing, Tumnus! Thank you."


"You are most welcome, Master William."

We ate in silence, except for the occasional yummy sound
I couldn"t help but make. Tumnus ate slowly, savoring every
bite, sitting up straight and proper as I hunched over and
gobbled. He seemed especially pleased when I got up and helped
myself to seconds.

As the meal wound down I looked outside to see that night
had fallen. "Oh... I forgot to feed the pups! Do we need to do
something for Moose?"

"I think it best if we let Moose fend for himself."
Tumnus said carefully as I got up, deposited my dish in the
sink, and fetched the dog bowls. "He can get a bit... messy."



"What does he eat?"

"Meat." Tumnus shivered. "Apologies, but we Faun are
vegetarians... the thought of eating raw, bloody meat is less
than appealing."

"He can fend for himself?" Frank and Fezzik perked up as
I filled their bowls.

"Oh yes. He's quite an accomplished hunter. He's actually
quite frugal, for an Ogre... an adult deer usually lasts him a
few days. He also supplements the fresh meat with my stew and
some of Hylonome's elixirs."

I whistled and Frank and Fezzik scrambled up, though
Fezzik moved much slower than normal. Concerned, I watched him
eat and realized that he was just exhausted... Moose had worn
him out.

As they ate Tumnus cleaned up the kitchen and put the
rest of the stew into a large ceramic jug, which he lifted
quite easily and put in the refrigerator alongside several
other identical jugs.


"Thank you again, Tumnus, that was amazing."

"I know I"m repeating myself, but it truly gives me
pleasure to know you enjoyed it so." He beamed at me and then
reached into his vest and pulled out a pipe. 'shall we adjourn
to the porch? I believe we have some things to discuss."


"Excellent idea."

We headed out through the screen door and Tumnus gestured
to the rocking chair. "Please sit."


"Are you sure? Where will you sit?"

"That chair is much to big for me, and quite frankly I
find it's motion unsettling. I"m fine right here." He curled
his legs under himself and sat up straight with his back
against the wall. When he was settled he pulled out a pouch of
tobacco he started filling his pipe.


I settled in and relaxed. Cicadas sang loudly from the
surrounding forest and the slight breeze rustled through the
trees. Occasionally an owl hooted or some animal called out
from deep within the woods. Frank and Fezzik wandered over and
stretched out across the porch in front of us, falling
promptly asleep. The entire scene was so peaceful I found
myself nodding.


'so, where were we?" Tumnus said, startling me awake.

"Uh... we were talking about rituals. You said I did
something a bit ago... just before dinner."

"Oh yes." He cleared his throat and took a deep pull of
his pipe before continuing. "My people are attuned to the
energy of the planes, and many of us can perform these rituals
to manipulate the world around us, usually in very small,
subtle ways." A cloud of sweet, earthy-smelling smoke drifted
past me as he spoke.


"Your people? You mean Fauns... or the Fae?"

He peered at me through a cloud of smoke. "You know of
the Fae?"

"The Lady spoke of them... of you, I guess. I also have
read a fair few fantasy novels and played some fantasy role-
playing games in my day."

"Indeed. That's good... very good. It makes it easier that
you are so open to these ideas." He nodded and took another
pull, letting the smoke settle a bit before saying, "Different
Fae have aptitude for different forms of manipulations. We
Faun are good at what's called "domestics", which includes
simple things like mending, cleaning, and manipulating
appearance in subtle ways. It all stems from our place in the
Fae ecosystem... you might say we are natural born servants and
housekeepers."


"How does changing your appearance fit in?"

He chuckled, "Nothing gets past you, does it Master
William. One aspect of keeping a proper house is keeping up


William. One aspect of keeping a proper house is keeping up

appearances, and that includes proper attendance to the formal
gatherings of the court. We must all look our best at such
things... to do less is to dishonor the court." He sighed. "Of
course, since the trouble, this is no longer an issue..."


"The Lady said her court had been destroyed."

"Indeed..." Tumnus looked so sad I felt I needed to change
the subject.


'so... what ritual did I perform?"

"Oh... yes..." He brightened and pointed the stem of his pipe
at me, "It was a binding... the simplest of which connects like-
minded creatures and creates a bond of trust. The most complex
are the destiny bindings, which are like geases... obligations
or prohibitions set upon the individuals in question,
hopefully for the long-term benefit of the larger community."


'so I created a bond of trust?"

"You did indeed." He smiled at me and took another drag
from his pipe.


"What does that do, exactly?"

"Well, for one thing... I can"t lie to you nor can you lie
to me. Well, we CAN lie, but the other will immediately know
it's a lie."

"I"m not inclined to lie anyway, so that doesn"t seem
like much."

"Oh but it is. You see... I KNOW that you can"t lie without
my detecting it, which means I never have to wonder or worry...
it's actually quite powerful. In addition, the ritual allows
us to know when the others bound by the ritual are in
trouble."


"That sounds very useful."

"Oh it is... and the final part... well..." He looked down and
fiddled with the chain of his pocket watch. "The final part


fiddled with the chain of his pocket watch. "The final part

may be more meaningful to we Fae than to you Humans, perhaps.
It is a welcoming... an opening of your heart, and a statement
of intention that you will honor and uphold each other
forevermore."

"That's actually very meaningful for Humans... we have
rituals of our own, like marriage, that attempt to do that." I
shook my head, thinking of Toby, "Though it's not really
binding at all... Humans often don"t realize what they are
agreeing to, and things fall apart pretty easily."

"Hmmm... yes, I see the parallel. In this case, though, the
stated intention comes directly from the heart, and it
connects the caster to their intended recipients. When a being
accepts, as I have, the connection is reciprocated."


"Can you reject the connection?"

"Absolutely! In this case, as you say, we are both
inclined toward honesty and helping each other, so it's a
natural extension of what we were already establishing. You
have to be very careful with whom you engage in this ritual,
Master William... it can leave you open and vulnerable to
attack. By it's very nature the ritual shuts down the natural
wards and protections you carry with you as a Human with Fae
blood. Without these defenses, a malevolently-inclined being
could do quite a bit of damage to your soul if they so chose."


"Wow... I"ll keep that in mind."

"That you were able to do this so casually speaks volumes
about your own abilities, Master William. And, by the way...
most Fae see the invitation as a gift... one of the most
generous ways to honor us. There are few from the Court of the
Lady who would seek to take advantage of your vulnerability.
That being said the Fae may no longer be as inclined to
accept, particularly in these troubled times."

"Can you teach me more about these rituals? I don"t want
to make a mistake that hurts anybody... or leaves me open to
attack, as you say."

"Goodness me no! No... The only ones who can teach such
things are the Centaurs and the Dragons... they are deeply


things are the Centaurs and the Dragons... they are deeply

versed in such things."


"Dragons? Are they the most powerful of the Fae?"

"You might think so, but no. Certainly Dragons are very
powerful. Our Lady is a Dragon " the most powerful of all "
but even she pales in comparison to the Faeries." He paused
and stared off into space. "Faeries are the source of the
magic that infuses all things. They are the caretakers of the
Land... the heart and soul of the Fae. Even the word Fae comes
from Faery... or maybe it's the other way around..." His voice
trailed off and he looked down at his hands, folded around his
pipe and resting in his lap, his ears drooping.


"What's wrong, Tumnus?"

"When..." he sniffed and wiped his nose. "When the magic
started fading in our world, it was because the Faeries were
weakening, somehow. Something was poisoning them, drawing out
their magic. It started slowly, but in recent years the
progression of this blight has increased significantly. Many
of the Faeries have died, and the few that are left are mere
shadows of their former selves."


"I"m so sorry to hear it... is there anything I can do?"


"The Lady must have told you your mission..."


"Yes. To help her folk survive."

Tumnus nodded, "Among the most important are the Faeries.
Without them we all will eventually fade... most will die but
some will turn back to their animal natures. Faun are the most
likely to revert to their foxlike ancestry. Others, like Moose
or Hylonome, will simply cease to be."


"Well then, let's help the faeries. Where do we start?"

Tumnus smiled sadly and said, "Well... I suppose we can
start with Nix. She's a faery who came here about fifty years
ago of her own accord. She nearly died on the other side and
came here to try to recover."


'she's here? Can I see her?"


"In good time... she's quite weak, and more than a little
scared. Even after all these years she doesn"t trust Humans...
and she hasn"t recovered any of her strength or magic."

I glanced down at Frank and said, "I bet I know someone
that can gain her trust."

Tumnus looked at Frank and nodded. "Yes... yes I believe
he's just the thing." He stood, stretched, and stepped forward
to knock his pipe against the railing. Frank and Fezzik awoke
and looked around blearily. "I will set things in motion...
perhaps tomorrow but certainly the day after at the latest,
depending on how Nix is feeling."

"Please tell her that I am here to help, and that she
should take all the time she needs..."

Tumnus looked at me for a moment and then nodded, "I
will... though perhaps I shan"t mention "all the time she
needs". Faeries are immortal... though not invulnerable,
unfortunately... so their concept of time is quite different
than ours."


"I"ll bear that in mind."

"Well... good night, Master William. I"ve made up the
master bedroom for you... you know where it is?"

I nodded, "I remember. Top of the stairs, all the way to
the right."

"That is correct. Sleep well, Master William..." He paused
and bowed, "It is an honor and a privilege to have you here."

"The honor is mine, Tumnus... thank you for all you"ve
done, and all you continue to do."

"My pleasure, sir." He turned and strolled inside, his
hooves clicking lightly on the wood.

I sat back and gazed at the stars peeking through the
tops of the trees... and drifted off into a deep, restful sleep,
lulled by the sound of the wind, the sleepy rustles of nature,


lulled by the sound of the wind, the sleepy rustles of nature,

and the gentle snores of puppies.


# Puppy Love

The next morning Tumnus met me in the kitchen as I poured
myself a cup of coffee.


"Good Morning, Master William. Did you sleep well?"

"Very." I rubbed my neck, "Though I have a bit of a crick
in my neck. I fell asleep in the chair."


"Oh dear, well... I"m sure some breakfast will help."

"I"m sure it will. Did you get a chance to talk with
Nix?"

"I"m sorry, sir, Nix does not feel well enough to come
down." Tumnus wrung his hands, frowning, "And it seems likely
that the stairs to the attic will be too much for good Mr.
Frank."

'she's in the attic? In the room that Toby and I shared
when we were small?"


"Indeed she is, Master William."

"Hmmm... well... do you think it would make a difference if I
promised to stay away? I mean... just let you introduce her to
Frank out here on the lawn for five minutes?"


"You feel strongly that this meeting should happen?"

"I do." I shrugged, "I can"t explain it, but I believe in
Frank's healing energy."

Tumnus turned to start preparing breakfast and said,
"Well... my goodness."


I looked to see what Tumnus was reacting t, and saw Moose
coming around the barn. "I wasn"t expecting to see him for
days."

"I bet I know what he wants." I dried my hands and
stepped to the door. "Fezzik! Who is it?"

Both dogs came bounding out of the living room as I
opened the door, barely getting it wide enough to avoid them
crashing into it. Frank slowed as he reached the porch steps,
looking around, but Fezzik spotted Moose and leapt down the
stairs, barreling forward like a freight train.

"Wow, they really like each other." I said, smiling.
Moose knelt down and opened his arms and Fezzik ran into him,
actually knocking the big ogre back a step with the force of
the impact. They wrestled for a moment and then Moose stood,
looking at the house expectantly.

I walked out to the the lawn so I didn"t have to shout
with Frank following behind me.

"Yes, Moose? What do you need?" Frank sat down and
watched Moose and Fezzik.


"Want... take Fezzik... to home."

I thought for a moment and said, 'sure, you can do that,
but bring him back here by late afternoon. Do not leave him
alone, Moose. He does not know the woods as well as you do and
he could get lost."

"I hear..." Moose said and smiled down at Fezzik, who
barked and wagged at him. Moose grunted and the two of them
headed back to the woods.

"You are certainly the leader now, Master William."
Tumnus said quietly as he stepped up beside me.


"I just hope I can lead well."

"Please don"t concern yourself, sir... Moose is a very
independent ogre. He just needs some direction sometimes. You
might consider giving him a job to do. Anything requiring


might consider giving him a job to do. Anything requiring

brute strength will suite him well, of course, and the simpler
the better."

"A job, eh? I"ll think about it." I turned back and
glanced up at the attic windows. I thought I saw some movement
there, but I couldn"t be sure. 'so... where shall I go to give
Nix some space?" I looked over at the Still House, "Is that
far enough away?"

"I think if you went in there and closed the door... and
tried not to make too much noise... that would be fine."

"Okay, why don"t you propose the idea to Nix and if she
says yes just wave at me through the window."

"I shall." Tumnus looked up at me, "But you haven"t had
your breakfast yet."

"I"ll be fine." I held up my coffee cup. "I"ll enjoy my
coffee and eat after Nix and Frank are done."

Tumnus nodded and smiled, "Thank you, Master William, for
being so considerate."


"I just hope that Frank can help."

Tumnus turned and headed back to the house. I knelt and
played gently with with Frank, keeping an eye on the attic
window.

Tumnus appeared and nodded, waving. I waved back and said
to Frank, "Wait here, Frank... you"re going to meet someone
special."

At the word "meet" he raised his ears and tilted his
head. Meeting new people was one of Frank's favorite things.

I gave him the signal to sit, then the signal to stay,
and headed down the drive to the Still House, pulling out my
keys and somehow managing not to spill my coffee. It took me
a moment to find the right key. I recalled my original
thoughts around learning how to distill whiskey, so it was
with some excitement that I let myself into the building.


The Still itself was a massive copper cauldron that
narrowed to a flat, angled pipe leading to a strange
contraption comprised of coils sitting in a large glass
barrel. I read a little about distilling when I first had the
idea, but seeing the still in person was daunting. It seemed
simple enough, but the sheer size of it made me step back and
wonder if I should even try.

I noticed that the floor of the still house was
constructed of large blocks of stone, and the walls and
supporting beams had the same copper base and fittings as the
barn. There was a drain in the center of the room underneath
the angled pipe.

I also noticed chips in the stone, and one very clear
hoofprint, reminding me that Hylonome worked the still from
time to time.

The room smelled like metal and dry grain with a strange,
musty oder underlying everything. A large double sink sat off
to one side with an old-fashioned manual water pump resting
beside it, the spout aimed into the sink. The bottom of the
pump fed into a block of old, cracked cement. I pumped the
handle a few times and a jet of dirty water flowed into the
sink. After a few more pumps the water cleared up.

Turning my attention back to the still, I found the hatch
near the top of the cauldron where it narrowed into the pipe.
The hatch was sealed with a wheel crank similar to a hatch in
an submarine. I spun the wheel and it moved easily, rewarding
me with a horrible stench as the hatch swung open.

Gagging and coughing I stepped back, wondering what had
died in there. Standing on tiptoes and peering in I saw a
layer of something black and tar-like coating the bottom of
the still. As my nose got used to the smell I realized a good
part of what I smelled was sulfur with strong earthy or mulchy
undertones. Aside from the sulfur the smell wasn"t actually
that bad, just very strong.

I knelt to inspect the base, which looked like a large
round franklin stove that someone had flattened and fitted to
the bottom of the cauldron. There was some ash in the base,
and tools for stoking the fire and some long-handled scrapers,


and tools for stoking the fire and some long-handled scrapers,

brushes and shovels hung on the wall beside the sink, but
there was no wood to be found in the Still House.

There was a soft knock at the door. I stepped up and
opened it a crack, and Tumnus stood there, gesturing for me to
come closer.

"Look, sir..." He whispered and gestured to where Frank was
dancing around a frail, childlike creature who was clapping
and laughing. "I..." A tear rolled down Tumnus" cheek. He wiped
it and sniffed, "I never thought I"d see the day... I"ve never
seen Nix laugh."

I watched as Frank work his magic. Soon they were
cuddling, the tiny being standing next Frank, who was sitting
and leaning his head on her shoulder. She put her arms around
him and stood there hugging him for a time.

Suddenly she stiffened and turned. I averted my eyes and
stepped back into the shadowy Still House.

"Well... that was marvelous." Tumnus said. 'she's gone back
into the house now, and Frank has followed her." He gazed at
me as I stepped back into the doorway, "How did you know?"

"It was a guess, though an educated one. Frank is very
special..."

Tumnus nodded, his expression solemn, and asked, "Have
you spoken to Master Tobias?"


"About the LINternet node? No, not yet."

"Well, I suggest perhaps that is a priority. It would be
devastating for poor Nix to come out of her shell only to lose
her newfound friend."

I nodded and said, "I"ll call him right now." I finished
my coffee and handed the cup to Tumnus.

"Very good, sir." Tumnus took my cup, turned and headed
back to the house. I closed everything up and locked the Still
House, returning the keys to my pocket and stepping out onto
the lawn.


Wondering how I would ask such a huge favor, I LINC"d to
Toby.


# Brotherly

Toby opened the connection immediately. "Hey little
brother! How's the farm?"

"Amazing... so much to talk about. Do you think you could
to come out here sometime soon?"


'sure! I"m not busy. I"d love to see the place."

"Great!" I paused and collected my thoughts. 'so, Toby... I
absolutely want to see you, but I do have an ulterior motive.
I want to talk to you about installing a LINternet node on the
properly."


"Whoa, Will... hang on... what do you need a node for?"

"For Frank. He's very sick, and the treatment requires
some special LINC-enabled equipment that the hospital loaned
to me."

"Aw, man... I"m so sorry. And the answer is absolutely yes
we can install a node."


I hesitated and then asked, "How much would it cost?"


"For you... nothing."


"Toby, no, come on... I can"t ask you to do that."

"The blunt truth is you couldn"t afford it, Will. The two
elements comprising an LINternet node cost a little over six
million dollars in total. Installation is a snap, but the seed
itself is four million and is used up in the process."


'six million... shit..."


"Don"t worry about it, bro. I have a prototype I"ve been
toying with, one with special environmental shielding. I"ve
been thinking about this for a long time, wondering when I"d
have the chance to test it out. I"d love to come out and
install it there for you."


"Really? Is it safe?"

"As houses. The modifications I made don"t affect
anything about the node itself. It generates a field that
repels critters."


"That sounds really complex."

"Piece of cake next to the node! And the worst it will
do is knock your critter unconscious if they run into it at
speed " like a bird flying into a window, only much easier on
the bird as the field is designed to absorb some of the
impact."


"How long will it take for you to get it ready?"


"How about tomorrow?"

"Tomorrow! Toby... that's crazy." I took a breath. "I... I
don"t know what to say."


"Then say 'see you tomorrow"."

I laughed, 'see you tomorrow, Toby... and thank you, again,
for saving me..."


"My pleasure little brother. See you soon."

I spent the rest of the day puttering around, going for a
walk with Frank, and making arrangements with Tumnus, who was
still worried about the Node but happy that Toby was going to
visit.

The next morning, as I was finishing up breakfast, a
fancy electric sports car pulled into the drive, silent but
for the crunching of the gravel. I stepped out onto the porch,
smiling.


"Hey little brother!" Toby jumped out and hurried over to
me. "LONG time, bro!"

"Toby!" I stepped down onto the drive. "How the hell did
you get here so early?"

"I got excited about seeing you... and I couldn"t sleep, so
I just left home around two A.M."


"Two? Even still that means..."

"Life in the fast lane, bro." He laughed and started
walking toward me. "LINC-enabled vehicles get special
permission... I topped out at 200 miles an hour at one point."


"Geez..."

I met him halfway and we hugged. I noticed how much
thicker he was... and how much older he looked. As if he read my
mind he leaned back and patted my midriff.


"How do you stay so thin?"


"Fine, clean country living. You"re looking good."

He let go and stepped back, patting his own midsection.
"Yeah, well... fighting the loosing battle of the bulge. All
that dirty politico-corporate living."

We laughed as he looked around. "MAN! This place has not
changed." He took a deep breath, 'smells the same too."


"I know. Feels timeless."

He looked at the farmhouse and whistled. "How is it in
such good shape?"

"Miss Thatcher had an ace up her sleeve. A caretaker she
never told us about. He's a wizard with pretty much everything
" carpentry, painting, plumbing."


"I"ve got to meet him! He's got to know how great it is



"I"ve got to meet him! He's got to know how great it is

that he's done this."


"Oh, he knows. I tell him pretty much every day."


'so he lives here?"

"In the proverbial "room under the stairs". Turns out
there's an entire separate basement... several in fact... that
Elijah Thatcher designed into the original architecture."


"Why would he do that?"

I shrugged, "Who knows? It was before prohibition so it
wasn"t to hide any illegal activities, but maybe he knew
there"d be a need for secrecy... or maybe he was just
eccentric."


"He's a Thatcher, so that's guaranteed."


We walked back to his car. "Wow... this is nice."

"Custom built, based on the old Lamborghini model... like
"Back to the Future"."


"You always loved that film."

"Yeah... 1.21 Gigawatts!" He laughed and then added, "That
seemed like a lot back then. Now we regularly talk about
Petawatts and Zettabytes..."


"And you said it's LINC enabled."

"Yep." He frowned, "Reception up here sucks, though. Had
to go on manual for the last fifty miles or so. You were
right... you need a node."


"Nearest node is at the university over in Presque Isle."

"Presque Isle? That's not that far away." He murmured
into his LINC and then cursed. "No signal."


"Well, it's 25 miles or so..."


Toby scoffed. "They must have the smallest, oldest,
cheapest node on record. Even the cheap ones today cover a
hundred miles or more." He reached into the tiny back seat of
his car and pulled out a silver briefcase. "THIS... now this is
NOT the smallest, cheapest node..."


"That's the node?"

"Yep. There are two parts to it " the power source, which
is a small dedicated Nuoun generator, and what we call the
'seed", which drives the generation of the appropriate Tau
field containing the fractal subdivision process." He patted
the briefcase, "This here contains the next generation
prototype, several orders of magnitude more powerful AND super
eco-friendly, like we talked about." He smiled, "I designed it
myself."

"Wow, amazing... but..." I shook my head, "...seed I get... and
eco-friendly... the rest is gibberish."

"Oh little brother." Toby sighed and chuckled. "Then
let's just call it magic and leave it at that."

"Fair enough." I leaned into his car and grabbed his
suitcase, fending off his protests, and we headed toward the
house. The car shut it's door automatically behind us with a
faint hum and click. "How did you put it together so fast?"

Toby chuckled, "We finished the initial prototyping and
testing a month ago. I started this work because I hated the
fact that some birds were killed by passing into the node at
speed. We added antiharmonics to the suppression field..." He
saw my expression and laughed, 'sorry... we added some magic to
deter creatures from coming near the node. It's completely
harmless now, even if they fly right into it."


"That sounds great... amazing, actually."

"It was a really interesting problem to solve." He
glanced around, "That your truck? Nice."

"Yeah, it's a complete mobile surgical clinic. LINC
enabled, you"ll be pleased to hear."


"You told me about the equipment, and why you need the
node... Tell me more about Frank."

As if they heard the name, Frank and Fezzik came
barreling around the house. They had been off somewhere with
Moose, who I asked to stay hidden until I figured out how to
make introductions. He seemed fine with that, always ready to
follow orders.

Fezzik froze when he spotted Toby, ears and tail
dropping. Frank bounded forward and stopped halfway between
Fezzik and us.

"Holy fuck, bro... they"re HUGE!" He stared at them for a
moment and then said, "Uh... what's that one doing?"

"Oh, that's Frank, doing his "happy to see a new person"
dance."

We watched Frank for a moment and then burst out
laughing. Toby put his briefcase down and knelt. "Wow... Frank...
you are WONDERFUL."

Frank bounded up and collided with Toby, sending him
sprawling on the grass and covering him with slobbery kisses.

While this was going on, Fezzik walked quietly up to sit
beside me, as he always did when Frank was greeting someone.
Toby laughed and wrestled with Frank as we watched, finally
managing to regain his feet when Frank backed off.


"Whew! Oh Will... Frank is amazing."


"Yeah, I know."

He turned and looked at me, wiping his face, and said,
"What's wrong?"

"Frank has a terminal heart condition." I felt my heart
sink as it always did when I thought about this.

"Oh, Will, I"m so sorry. You said he was sick, bit I
didn"t know he was THAT sick."


Frank padded up to me, sat on my other side, and leaned
against me, gazing up at me adoringly. I choked up as I always
did when he took care of me like this. I reached down to
scratch behind his ears.

"Yeah. He's probably going to die before he hits one year
old." I sniffed and wiped my nose. "I wanted him to be here
when he does."

"Yeah, that's spot on." Toby murmured as he picked up the
briefcase. He walked over to me, putting his hand on my
shoulder. "We"ll get it done, little brother... for Frank."


"For Frank."


"Who's this other beast... and man, when I say beast..."


"That's Fezzik."

"From Princess Bride? That's awesome... he sure is the
biggest and the strongest... how much does he weigh?"

"He's seven and a half months, 175 pounds... about 31
inches at the shoulder."


"Damn! How big is he going to get?"

"Probably top out around 270 or so... depending on whether
I can afford to feed him."


Toby whistled. "He's a lot more mellow than Frank."


"He's the watchful older brother."


"Hah! Nice..." He sobered and said, "Can I say hi?"

'sure. Don"t expect the same kind of greeting, but once
you"re in with Frank you"re okay with Fezzik."

Toby knelt in front of Fezzik and said, "Glad to make
your acquaintance, Fezzik."


Fezzik gazed at him for a moment and then leaned forward
and slurped Toby's face with one long, slobbery lick from chin
to forehead.


"Aw... man!" Toby sputtered and Fezzik thumped his tail.


'see? He likes you."

"Right... good..." Toby stood and wiped his face again. "I"m
gonna need a shower."


"Then let's get you settled."


We headed into the farmhouse, the dogs trailing behind.


# Nodification

'so that's it?" I looked at the six egg-shaped objects in
Toby's briefcase. We sat at the kitchen table, sipping tea.

"Yeah, well... that's three sets. The silver one's the
Nuoun generator, and the rust-colored one's the network seed."


"How long does it take to install a node?"

"Well, so far the longest a node has taken has been about
forty-five minutes."


"Forty-five?! That's incredible."

"Yeah, the Nuoun generator produces an incredible amount
of energy. The process involves fractal subdivision of N-
space... basically bending the dimensions within the node region
until each plane is adjacent to the next."


"That sounds really complicated."

"It is, but it's also really beautiful, mathematically-
speaking. Have you ever seen a Mandelbrot set?"


"No, what's that?"

"Better to show you." He murmured something and an image
appeared in the center of my vision. It looked like a top-down
picture of a beetle.


"Zoom in one one edge... and keep zooming..."

I murmured into my LINC and the image expanded, showing
me that the edge was comprised of a large number of wrinkles,
each one a duplicate of the original. I went in for a while
and saw that it just kept on going.


"Wow, that's amazing... it's like beetles all the way
down." I looked up and winked. "Paul would be so proud."


"Paul?"


"McCartney? Of the Beatles...?"


"Oh, Will, you"re such a dork."


"Takes one to know one."

"Touche." We laughed and then Toby said, "The Mandlebrot
set is specifically described in two-dimensional space.
Imagine if, instead, it extended into three... four... five
dimensions and more."


"That makes my head hurt."

"Then you"re starting to see what's going on. We
discovered a way to take an infinitely expansive
multidimensional space and apply an infinitely recursive
subdivision algorithm to it, performing physical "bending" of
space using Lipton and Tau manipulations."


"Headache getting worse."

"That's the magic, bro." He sat back, smiling, "Best way
to think of it is the old 'shortest distance" formula. What's
the shortest distance between two points?" He saw my blank
expression and shook his head, "Aw come on, Will... basic
geometry!"


"A line?"

"Very good. Now... what if we could bend that line so the
points moved next to each other."


"Wouldn"t that create another line? A shorter one?"

"Nope, it simply removes the distance between the points.
So in the LINternet node, every single point in every single
dimension is very, very close to every other point."



"Wow... I get it. Good work on the explanation, Toby."


"Thanks! I have to do that a lot..."

"I can only imagine... but... where do you stop? I mean, you
said "very, very close"."

"That's the petadollar question, bro... there's a limit,
based on Tau field physics, where the amount of energy it
takes to subdivide the space shoots up beyond exponential
growth. Even with the extreme amount of power we get from the
most advanced Nuoun generators, we can"t push it beyond a
certain point. It's actually diminishing returns after that
anyway, as every step can only reduce the distance so much."
He sighed, 'so, what we get is "near instantaneous
connections" with "extremely low cost and loss of data"... but
not truly instantaneous, free, and lossless."

"That makes sense." I nodded and gestured at the eggs.
'so what do you have to do to install the node? I guess you
have to build some kind of tower..."

"Nothing nearly so involved. We need to place the two
components at the center of where we want the node to grow "
as stable as possible but it doesn"t have to be rigid " and
then let them do their thing. Once the node is established,
it's permanent and does not require any physical support."


"Whoah... permanent? What if we need to move it?"

"You can"t. That's another thing we haven"t been able to
figure out. You CAN remove it, but the seed is destroyed in
the process and the area becomes inert... you can"t put a new
node over where an old one used to be."

"Uh... doesn"t that worry you? It sounds like you damaged
space-time or something."

"No. We"ve done extensive research and experimentation on
this over the years. The area where the node used to exist is
precisely the same as non-node space to every form of energy
we"ve thrown at it and every measurement we"ve taken of it.
The space simply unfolds itself and resists further tampering.


The space simply unfolds itself and resists further tampering.

We don"t know why... but we do know it has basically no other
effect."

I wasn"t convinced, but I let it drop. 'so... when can we
begin?"

"No time like the present." He stood, picked up one
silver and one rust egg, and tossed them to me, laughing as I
fumbled to catch them. "And don"t worry, they are pretty much
indestructible."

He led the way back to his car, where he pulled out an
extending metal pole and a tripod base. As we headed back to
the farmhouse he stopped, turned, and said, "Wait... just a
sec..." before running back to his car.

He opened the driver-side door, fiddled with something
under the dashboard, and then stepped back, pushing the door
shut by hand.


When he joined me again I said, "What was that about?"

"I needed to turn off the Nuoun generator. Having
powerful nuoun generators in close proximity can sometimes
lead to instability. Haven"t quite figured that one out yet
either..."

"Aren"t these powered by Nuoun generators as well?" I
pointed to my LINC earbud. 'should I remove it?"

"Nah, that's not nearly powerful enough. In fact the one
in my car is probably too small to make a difference, but just
in case..."

We headed toward the field behind the farmhouse. "What
kind of instability? Is it dangerous?"

"Not at all... worst situation was losing a seed one time.
That's why I brought extras." He smiled at me, "Don"t worry,
bro... I got you covered."


"I know you do, and I appreciate it."


We spent some time wandering around the field looking for
the best place to put the node. We finally decided to put it
smack dab in the middle of the field, high enough that we
could drive a tractor underneath it. It took Toby two minutes
to set up the tripod, put the eggs in a harness on the pole,
and fit the pole into the tripod. He extended the pole it's
full length - twenty feet " and stepped back, murmuring into
his LINC.

A bright blue light came on on the Nuoun generator and
Toby turned to me and said, "Okay... we"ve got 9.4 foot radius,
twenty-three foot elevation, nice clear area with no trees...
ready?"


"As I"ll ever be."

"Let's go!" He murmured again and the Nuoun generator
light came on. After a moment what looked like a mist, edged
in a bright light, flowed out of the seed and expanded into a
perfect sphere centered on the seed. The sphere seemed to
solidify, and the surface became mirror-like, reflecting the
field, the trees, the sky, and the two of us.


After a minute or so Toby said, "Huh."


"Huh?"

"That's... oh... wow..." he murmured again and then pulled a
tablet out of his jacket pocket, turning it and tapping
rapidly on it's surface, "wow! Holy..." His fingers flew across
the screen, which expanded into a wide holographic display
full of hundreds of dials, meters, and charts.


"Toby, what's""

'shh!" He continued to work, pulling different displays
together and merging them to get a different view on the data.
At one point he gasped and turned, dragging a chart into the
center of his view and expanding it. "Holy. Shit."


"Toby! Tell me what's going on!"


"Do you have a Nuoun generator... maybe in your truck?"



"Uh... oops."

"Yeah, oops. Looks like a pretty powerful one too. Let me
guess... one of those mobile medical units?"


"Yeah."

"Wow... okay then." He shut down the display with a wave of
his hand and put the tablet away. Turning back to the node,
which was still covered in a mirrorlike surface, he added,
"Well, we"ve solved the Tau field limitations."


"Uh... come again?"

"Remember what I talked about... how we couldn"t get past a
certain point because of the exponential energy cost? Well...
your additional Nuoun generator is apparently positioned
exactly 53.38 meters away... hmmm... that's odd."


"What's odd?"

"The resonance shells respond at specific intervals... one,
two, four, eight, etc. In between their not supposed to be
able to create the necessary harmonics. But this... your nuoun
generator is 17 points away... 17 times pi, that is... not 16."


"Pi? Resonance shells? Sorry for my ignorance..."

"Not a problem, bro. Three point one four, etc, etc...
otherwise known as pi... is one of those magical numbers that
keeps recurring throughout the fundamental laws of physics.
One of the basic laws we brush up against here has to do with
what's called harmonic resonance shells " these are precise
intervals at which the field manipulations feed back on
themselves, creating stable waveforms. Starting at 3.14
meters, or pi, and repeating at regular intervals " 2 pi, 4
pi, 8 pi, 16 pi " get it? If we have another power source at
precisely the point where one of these shells exist, it
creates a self-sustaining resonance that impacts our field
manipulations."


"But my generator is at 17 pi."


"That's the weird part. In the past we"ve experimented



"That's the weird part. In the past we"ve experimented

with these shells and the result is normally an off-the-charts
growth in cost... as in very bad for business. At pi meters it's
actually impossible to even start the process. We tried 2 and
4 and saw very little difference... we went up through 32 with
no measurable advantage. We never dreamed that 17 would be
another magic number." He pulled out the tablet again and took
some measurements. "Woah..."


"What is it?"

"Well, I"ll need to do a lot more research... and I"ll need
Ahmer and Cyndi here to help as they"re experts in their part
of the node... but my rough calculations show that the 17 point
harmonic actually reduces the cost..." He whistled and looked
up. "It looks linear, bro... and damn close to zero."

He laughed and started to dance around, whooping and
hollering. Frank and Fezzik who had been sleeping in the sun
leapt up and started dancing with him.

'so you"re saying that because my truck was parked where
it is, and because I forgot about the Nuoun generator... this
node has passed the limit? Instead of "nearly instantaneous"
and "very low cost" connections..."

"We are right now looking at distances so small they
can"t be measured. The fractal edge is approaching infinity..."

I looked at the perfect mirrored sphere floating ten feet
above the ground and said, "Is it... stable?"

"Completely! That's the beauty of this... the nature of the
process is to subdivide through N-space... worst that can happen
is it runs out of power, or the subdivision gets unstable and
unravels. We had that happen a lot in the early days... it was
one of the first things we solved."


'so nothings going to blow up even if it keeps on going?"

"No bro, it won"t blow up... it"ll just continue until...
well..." He peered at his calculations and tapped a few more
times. "It IS increasing in cost, but linear, like I said.
There will be a point... maybe a few hours from now... where the
cost exceeds the combined maximum output of the generators. It


cost exceeds the combined maximum output of the generators. It

can"t actually reach infinity - or absolute zero distance "
but it will be DAMN close."


'so this is... good?"

He stared at me for a moment and then shook his head,
"Will... this is huge. Bigger than huge. The distance of the
connections was the sticking point, why we needed so many
nodes... best coverage we could hope for was four hundred miles
or so " at harmonic shell 128. It works as an inverse relation
to the cost of transmission... the closer the points within the
N-Space fractal the cheaper the transmissions, and thus the
further out a client can be from the node." He tapped a few
more times and then whistled. "This node is covering around
four times our current maximum coverage right now... at harmonic
shell 512 and growing."

I felt something change in the air. My hair stood on end
and both Fezzik and Frank sat down and whined, shaking their
heads. Some birds took off in the woods and something howled
in the distance. The feeling passed quickly, leaving me with a
slightly metallic taste in my mouth.


"What was that?"

"Node came online." He looked down at his tablet. "Oh...
holy fuck, bro... holy fuck."


"What is it?"

"Process is still going on, but the node stabilized and
has established full connection. The initial MI sequence is
already complete, which normally takes a few hours. The
statistics are staggering... connections so fast we can"t
measure the lag, and the MI core is running over thirty orders
of magnitude faster than the fastest machine in existence
today." Toby stared at me, mouth open, "Bro... we"ve done it! I
can"t wait to see the looks on Ahmer and Cyndi's faces!"

I stared at the sphere, more than a little afraid of what
we"d done. I couldn"t talk to Toby about it " he"d just scoff
and dismiss my fears " but deep in my heart I knew we just
created a monster.


# First Contact

Toby and I sat at the table finishing up Tumnus"
fantastic stew. It turned out that he had four different stews
that he kept in the fridge, adding and refining over time and
dolling out meals to Nix, Hylonome, Moose, and the other one
whose name I didn"t yet know.

Tumnus was not comfortable joining us at the table,
whispering to me that he felt close and comfortable with me
but that Toby was still a stranger. He hovered in the
background for most of our meal before disappearing to bring
Nix her meal.

He came back with a worried expression on his face. "Uh...
Master William? A word, if I may?"


"Of course, Tumnus... excuse me Toby."

"Absolutely, little bro. I"ve got some calls to make."
Toby pushed back from the table and said, "Tumnus, you are
incredible... thank you so much for that delicious meal!"

"It is truly my pleasure, Master Tobias." Tumnus bowed
his little bow and then gestured for me to follow. "This way,
Master William."


"Is everything alright?"

"I don"t honestly know, sir." He led me upstairs and
around to the back staircase leading up to the attic. "It's
Nix, sir... she's... asked to see you."

"Really? I"m honored." I saw the look on Tumnus" face and
said, "Or maybe I should be worried? What is it, Tumnus?"


'she... something happened this afternoon that has agitated



'she... something happened this afternoon that has agitated

her. She's been pacing her room, unable to rest. Her health is
such that this is worrying, sir."


"Well let's go see if there's anything I can do for her."


"Be warned, sir... she's not like anyone you"ve ever met."

"I"ll keep that in mind." We reached the door to the
attic bedroom and I held up a hand. "Just a sec."


"Of course, sir."

I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, calming my
nerves and letting go of my preconceptions. I pictured the
tiny, frightened, fragile creature behind the door and felt my
heart open to her. I was careful not to project anything as I
had with Tumnus. I just opened my mind and my heart and let my
natural empathy flow through me.


'sir..." Tumnus" voice trembled. "Oh sir."


I opened my eyes and said, "I"m ready."

Tumnus nodded at the door and I stepped up and knocked
gently. "Nix? I"m here."

The door opened into a dark room. I knew the attic
bedroom really well, but it had been a long time since I was
up here. I took a breath and stepped into the room, listening
carefully with eyes wide open trying to see where I was going.

The door swung shut behind me, shrouding me in darkness,
and an image of a drowning child floated into my mind.

I breathed and imagined myself swimming out to the child
with a life preserver over one arm.

An image of a wounded child, bleeding from a cut in her
head, replaced the drowning child.

I breathed and pictured myself gently tending the wound,
making sure it was clean and sewing it up.



An image of Frank floated into my head. He was dead.

I breathed, my breath catching in my throat, and I
started to cry. In my minds eye I knelt down beside Frank and
gently picked him up, cradling him in my arms and rocking him
gently.

The images cleared. I stood there, weeping, hugging
myself, and a tiny hand touched my arm.

I drew a shuddering breath and opened my heart, letting
my tears flow freely.

An image of the node, seen from above, floated into my
head. I felt a strong urge to go to it.

I nodded and wiped my nose, kneeling down slowly and
opening my arms.

Nix crawled into my arms and I held her gently. She was
shivering. I breathed in and embraced her in my mind as I
hugged her with my arms.


Her shivering faded.

I stood, turned, and the door opened, startling Tumnus.
When he saw me stepping up to the door holding Nix in my arms
he gasped and nearly fell down the stairs.

I walked carefully down the stairs, crossed to the other
side, and walked down into the living room. Nix tensed when
she heard my brother's voice coming from the kitchen. I
hurried to the back of the house and went out the back door.

Toby had removed the pole and tripod when the node
finished forming just before dinner. It was a little eerie to
see the silvery sphere just floating there. I could feel Nix
yearning to get closer.

I walked slowly to the fence and swung over it, making
sure Nix faced the Node as I moved. When we reached the sphere
she stretched her arms out toward it. Through some trick of
the light it seemed that her skin was glowing slightly.


I helped her scramble onto my shoulders and I felt her
urging me to move underneath the sphere.


"But... it might hurt you, Nix."

The urge intensified. I could almost feel her willing my
legs to move.


"Okay... you know best."

I stepped under the sphere and she suddenly grabbed my
wrists, shifted her feet onto my shoulders, and stood,
thrusting her hand into the sphere.


"Nix, no!"

There was a blinding flash of light and I found myself
lying on my back ten feet away, my ears ringing. Tumnus yelled
and ran over.


"Master William, are you alright?"


"Yes... yes... but Nix!"

'she's... oh... oh my." Tumnus stood and stepped back,
staring at the node. He pointed and said, "Look."

I pushed myself up on my elbows and saw Nix floating in
midair with both hands pressed against the base of the sphere.
As I watched, she started to glow brighter, sparks flowing
over her body. Then she began to shrink.

Energy crackled out of the sphere and she convulsed,
arching her back in a silent scream that somehow filled my
head, making it difficult to think. I jumped up and staggered
toward her.

A tremendous, silent burst of energy threw Nix backwards,
trailing multicolored sparks as she flew. Her body continued
to shrink, creating the illusion that she was flying at
incredible speed. She landed twenty feet away and rolled to a
stop.


I staggered over to her and saw that she was still
shrinking and giving of light bright enough to illuminate the
area around her. By the time I reached her she was tiny... about
the size of my hand, and her skin glowed with a pearly
radiance that nearly blinded me.

I closed my eyes, seeing afterimages floating across my
vision, and heard a gasp from behind me and a distinct popping
sound from where Nix lay.

"Bro! What happened?!" Toby called out from the
farmhouse. I opened my eyes but I couldn"t see Nix anywhere.

Squinting through the afterimages I could barely make him
out. "Uh... something flew into the node. Some kind of bird."


"Fuck! Where is it?"


"It flew off."

"Damn. It must have been really big or something. The
node cut out for a second." He walked up to it, inspecting
it's surface, and pulled out his tablet. "Well... everything
seems normal..." He turned back to me and said, "Why are you all
the way over there?"

"I thought I saw it land over here. I guess I was wrong."
I rubbed my eyes, the afterimages still burning in the center
of my vision.


"You okay?"

"Yeah, just... got a little freaked out. YOU may know this
thing is stable, but I"m still not convinced."

Toby laughed, "Well, no worries on that front, bro. The
node is as stable as always... maybe Ahmer and Cyndi can do a
better job explaining it."


"Are they coming here?"

"Cyndi's going to fly in tomorrow early afternoon and
Ahmer"ll drive up from Boston... he"ll probably be here around


Ahmer"ll drive up from Boston... he"ll probably be here around

noon."


"They won"t come together?"


"Ahmer hates helicopters."


"Oh! Cyndi's coming in a helicopter?"

"Yep. The lady's nuts, I tell you... flies a chopper, has
like six PhDs... she's one very accomplished, very crazy lady."


"I look forward to meeting her."

"Come on back inside... we"ve got lots to talk about before
they get here. I brought some good beer!"

"Be right there." I gestured to Tumnus, who was standing
near where I had fallen, wringing his hands. He hurried over
and met me as I walked toward the farmhouse.


I whispered, "Where's Nix?"

"I don"t know." He shook his head. "This... this is
unprecedented. You saw the glow?"


"I did. Nearly blinded me."

"THAT was magic. She disappeared just as Master Tobias
came out of the house."


"Really? How?"

"I have no idea, but... it looked like she had magic again.
When faeries lose their magic their bodies revert back to a
humanoid norm... they grow to the size of a human child and lose
their wings, their glow... everything."


'so their magic makes them smaller? That's weird."

"I"m sure there's a reason for it... The Lady could tell
you."


Toby shouted from the doorway, holding up two large



Toby shouted from the doorway, holding up two large

bottles, "Will, come on! Beer's getting warm."

"Coming!" I turned back to Tumnus, 'see if you can find
her and make sure she's okay."

"I will, Master William, and I"ll enlist the help of the
others." Tumnus peered at me, "Are you sure YOU"RE alright?
You took quite a tumble."

"Yes I"m fine." I smiled. "Nothing a little beer won"t
help."

Tumnus chuckled and nodded. "Very good sir. We"ll find
Nix... don"t you worry."


"Thank you."

I headed back to the farmhouse and joined Toby, who went
right back to talking excitedly about the Node and it's
possibilities. I listened with one ear, sipping beer and
wondering about what just happened.


# Nixing

The next morning I arose before Tumnus, which was very
unusual. He emerged, yawning and rubbing his eyes, as the
kettle started to boil.


"Oh... Master William... I"m so sorry..."

"No worries, Tumnus!" I lowered my voice, "Did you find
her?"

He frowned and shook his head. "Though I know she's
alive."


"How?"

"I can feel it." He shrugged, "It's difficult to
explain."

"Well, I"m glad she's alive. I"m sure she"ll make an
appearance sometime."

"Hmmm... yes." Tumnus took over making the coffee. I
stepped back and sat down at the table.


"Why wouldn"t she?"

'she's a bit of a loner... though her actions last night
with you belie this behavior."


"Yeah, I was surprised."

'surprised? I was flabbergasted. The fact that she wanted
to be in the same room with you was shocking... the fact that
she let you touch her is nothing short of a miracle." Tumnus
poured a mug of coffee and set it in front of me. "Master
William, I have to ask... what happened? Both in the attic and


William, I have to ask... what happened? Both in the attic and

out there in the field."

"Well... up in the attic she tested me... put some scenarios
in my mind and watched how I responded." I sipped my coffee.
"When she showed me Frank lying there dead I lost it." I shook
my head. "It was so real."


"Ah... yes... that makes sense."


"It does?"

"Yes. She quite obviously bonded with Frank, as you so
astutely predicted... when she saw your reaction she knew that
you were a kindred spirit in this at least." He shook his
head, 'she must have been desperate, though, to allow you to
physically touch her. No offense, Master William... but she's
always been terrified of Humans."

"None taken, of course. I can understand why she would be
scared. If she can read minds like she projected images, she
must have witnessed her share of Human ugliness and
ignorance." I sighed, "Keats" visit must have been the icing
on the cake."

"That's a good point." Tumnus pulled at his beard. "I
hadn"t thought of that, but of course you are correct. She
wouldn"t have to be anywhere near a Human to hear their
thoughts."

"Hearing thoughts? What?" A sleepy, rumpled Toby wandered
into the kitchen. "What are you talking about?"

Tumnus looked scared so I responded, "Just the usual
"what if the world had magic" stuff... you know me and my weird
fantasies."

"Yeah, bro, I do. Every other guy is dreaming about hot
chicks... and you dream of Dragons."


"They"re pretty hot..."

"The fire-breathing ones, sure." We laughed and he
gestured at the coffee urn, "Is that coffee?"


"Coming right up, Master Tobias." Tumnus deftly poured
another mug and placed it on the table.

"You are a godsend, Tumnus." Toby slumped down on a chair
and took a big sip. "Ah... marvelous. Is there anything you
can"t do perfectly, Tumnus?"


"Well... I"m not so good at cutting hair..."

We all laughed and settled in, Toby and I sipping coffee
and chatting about nothing in particular while Tumnus made us
a huge breakfast. Tumnus surprised me by sitting down at the
table with his cup of tea as we ate.

After we ate, Toby sat back and finished the last of his
coffee, saying, "Where are the dogs?"

"Huh... I don"t know." I shrugged, "I haven"t seen them
since I fed them this morning."


"Aren"t you worried?"

I thought about Moose and shook my head, "Nah. They know
enough to not go far."


"If you say so."

Tumnus and I exchanged a glance and he nodded slightly.
I stood, stretched, and said, "Tumnus, why don"t you let me
clean up for once?"

"Very good, Master William... I have some other chores to
attend to." He took off his apron, washed his hands, and
headed out the side door as I stepped up and started cleaning.

As I was finishing up Tumnus came back in, his expression
unreadable. "Masters... I found Frank."


My heart sank, "Is he okay?"

"Oh yes, at least, I think so. He's out back, sitting
under that Node of yours."


"Really?" I dried my hands and the three of us headed out
back. There was Frank, sitting under the Node, staring up at
it with his ears raised and his head tilted as if he was
listening to something. Toby and I walked to the field and
hopped the fence.

When we reached Frank Toby pulled out his epad and
started tapping away.

I knelt down next to Frank, who hadn"t acknowledged our
arrival other than a twitch of one ear, and whispered, "Hey
Frank... whatcha doin" bud-bud?"

Frank turned and looked at me, thumping his tail a few
times, and then turned back to the Node, once again tilting
his head to one side.

"Well, the node is the same... no emissions or anomalies...
other than operating multiple orders of magnitude higher than
it should." Toby put away his tablet. "I wonder if this has
something to do with yesterday's little incident." He turned
to Tumnus, who stood by the fence, and asked, "Tumnus, did you
ever find any trace of that bird?"


"No sir, and that's not for lack of searching."

"Thank you for looking... hmmm... I know dogs" hearing is
different... maybe the repulsion field is making a sound that he
can hear." Toby turned back to me and said, "Boy am I glad
Cyndi and Ahmer are coming today. Too many weird things for
my little brain to comprehend." He turned back toward the
house, "Which reminds me... I have a lot of work to do to prep
for their arrival. Anything you need me for?"

"Nah, I think we can manage." I petted Frank, who leaned
against me but continued to stare at the Node.

"Great. Call me if you need me." Toby headed back to the
house.

I sat with Frank for a bit. At one point I leaned in to
listen to his heart " still irregular, but strong, and I
didn"t hear any gurgling as he breathed.


"Everything alright?" Tumnus said. I looked up to see him
walking toward me.

"Yes, he seems fine... other than his obsession with the
node..."


"I am relieved." Tumnus seemed distracted.


"What's on your mind, Tumnus?"

'sir... obviously I have no idea about this Node or how it
works... but is it possible for something to get inside it?"

"Not as I understand it. Toby said they added some kind
of protective layer that's supposed to repel animals and
insects..."


"What if that doesn"t work on Faeries?"

I looked up at the Node and then back down at Frank. "You
think...?"

"Mr. Frank is a very sensitive creature... and he seemed
particularly taken with Nix..."

I nodded and stood, stretching my back, "That makes a
great deal of sense, Tumnus. Good thinking... except of course
for the fact that it's supposedly impossible."

"Well, hearing you and Master Tobias discussing matters
yesterday, it seems that this particular Node is quite
different than normal. I heard Master Tobias say several times
that what happened here was not supposed to be possible..."

"Good point, once again." I sighed and looked down at
Frank, "I guess we"ll find out." I turned back to Tumnus, "You
said you could feel Nix's energy... or something like that. Can
you get a sense of direction? Is the feeling stronger here?"

Tumnus closed his eyes and took a deep breath. When he
opened them he shook his head, "No... but I do feel a strange,
somewhat unpleasant vibration coming from the Node."


"That would probably be that protective shield Toby
talked about. I can sort of hear a high-pitched whine coming
from it if I turn my head in a certain direction... could be
what Frank is hearing."


"Could be..." Tumnus" brow furrowed. 'so what do we do?"

"I guess we wait... watch Frank and make sure he's okay...
and see if Nix comes back."

"Very good, Master William. I will keep an eye on Frank,
if you"d like. My daily chores are focused on the farmhouse
today, so it will be quite easy to watch him."


"That would be great, Tumnus... thank you."

He turned and headed back to the house. I knelt and sat
with Frank some more, staring up at the Node.

"I hope you"re okay, Nix... please be okay." I whispered. I
closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and let feelings of
gratitude and love fill my mind. Gratitude for Nix's trust in
me, and love for a creature who obviously loved Frank as much
as I did. As I breathed out I imagined embracing Nix and
welcoming her into my heart. In my mind's eye Frank, Nix, and
I danced and played, expressing the pure joy of life in the
moment.

Something shifted in the air. A warm glow spread through
me and the world behind my closed eyes brightened, like the
sun breaking through the clouds on a stormy mid-summer's day.

Frank barked, once, and I opened my eyes. As I did so the
glow and light faded, but a deep feeling of gratitude
remained. Frank stood, turned, and licked my face so
vigorously he knocked me over.

Laughing, I wrestled with him for a moment... and an image
come unbidden into my mind. A tiny, sparkling point of light
danced and wove through the air between us, wreathing us in a
shower of golden light. As soon as it appeared the image
faded, and both Frank and I sat back, staring at each other.


"Thank you, Nix." I whispered.


Frank stood, shook off, and trotted back toward the
house. I sat for a moment, savoring the feelings of love and
gratitude, and then stood. Turning I saw Tumnus standing by
the back door of the house, staring at me. When he saw me
looking he straightened, adjusted his vest, and smiled.

I nodded, smiled back, and went to see if Toby needed my
help.


# Triumvirate

Right after lunch, a large black Land Rover pulled up
into our driveway and drove up to park next to Toby's car. As
we made our way out onto the porch, the driver stepped out of
the vehicle. She was wearing a jean jacket and matching, faded
blue jeans, boots, and a white turtleneck. Her long blond hair
was pulled back into a ponytail, held in place by a purple
hair tie. She leaned on the door, facing into the car, having
an intense but good-natured argument with her passenger... like
siblings rather than rivals.

"Cyndi!" Toby called out, stepping off the porch and
hurrying forward with arms outstretched. I stepped down and
stopped at the edge of the driveway, waiting for
introductions.

Cyndi straightened and turned, bright blue eyes widening
as she spotted Toby. My heart skipped a beat when I saw how
beautiful she was. I recognized her immediately " the
charismatic genius founder and chief scientist of Nuoun
corporation. She was much more beautiful in person. She smiled
and stepped forward, "Toby... long time."

"Far too long." They hugged as the passenger got out of
the Land Rover. He was a short, plump, dark-skinned man whose
mannerisms and dress were the opposite of Cyndi's. He wore an
exquisitely-tailored three-piece suit, and hesitated as he
stepped out of the car... frowning as he placed his pristine
patent leather shoes on the dirty ground.

I recognized the man as well " a much older version of
Ahmer Kotamreddy, Toby's college roommate and long-time
partner.

"Ahmer... thank you for coming." Toby let go of Cyndi and
stepped back, smiling at Ahmer.


"This had better be" oh god... dogs..." Ahmer straightened
and backed up against the Land Rover, eyes wide, as Frank and
Fezzik bounded around the house toward us.

"Frank, Fezzik, heel!" I said and Fezzik turned, ran up
to me, and sat promptly. Frank, surprisingly, ignored me.
"Frank!"

"Oh god..." Ahmer's already wide eyes widened further and
he held out his hands defensively as Frank ran up. "That's far
enough!"


Frank stopped, turned, and started to dance.

Ahmer lowered his hands slowly and asked, "Uh... what's it
doing?"

"Frank is doing his "happy to meet a new person dance".
He's glad you"re here."


"Uh..."


Cyndi murmured, "Incredible..."

Frank introduced some extra steps in his dance, twirling
as if he were chasing his tail. I noticed that he slowly edged
closer to Ahmer as he did so. Ahmer stared at Frank, and after
a moment he began to smile.

Frank continued his dance until we were all laughing,
Ahmer included. Then, suddenly, Frank stopped and stepped
close to Ahmer.

"AH!" Ahmer raised his hands and picked up his foot,
pressing back against the car. Frank froze and sat, staring up
at Ahmer's face. "What... what's he doing now?"

"He's never seen anyone who's been afraid of him before."
I said, quietly, "I think he's trying to understand... and help
you be more comfortable."

Cyndi sighed and shook her head. I glanced over and saw
that she wasmesmerized by Frank.


Frank sat for a while, staring up at Ahmer, until Ahmer
lowered his arms and put his foot back down. As soon as Ahmer
relaxed a little, Frank reached his paw out and placed it
gently on Ahmer's foot, keeping eye contact the entire time.


"Wow..." Cyndi whispered... "wow."

Ahmer's shoulders relaxed and he whispered something to
Frank. Frank immediately rolled over on his back, legs in the
air, and stared up at Ahmed expectantly. Ahmed twitched at the
sudden movement but then laughed, shaking his head. He knelt
slowly down and reached out toward Frank's chest.

"Holy shit..." Toby murmured, "...holy shit. Ahmed is
terrified of dogs. I"ve never seen him touch one... ever..."

Frank lay there, tail wagging, not moving as Ahmed
scratched his chest and belly.

After a moment Ahmed stood, brushing off his hands, and
straightened his jacket.

Frank rolled carefully over and stood, walking slowly
back toward the house.

Cyndi knelt and reached out her hands, tears glistening
in her eyes. Frank walked up and snuggled with her, nestling
between her arms and wriggling as she hugged and petted him.

"You okay, Ahmer?" Toby asked quietly. "I"m so sorry... I
forgot to tell Will that you didn"t like dogs."

"Yes, well... perhaps I"ll make an exception here." Ahmed
looked at me and nodded, "Hello William..."

"Ahmer, good to see you again." I gestured at Frank and
Fezzik. "I can put them in the house, but if you"re going to
be here for a while it"ll be difficult to keep them away."

"No... no, I think I can manage." Ahmed smiled weakly,
"That is one very special dog you have there."



"Yeah, he is."

Fezzik stood and joined Frank, the two of them covering
Cyndi in dog hair and drool. She laughed and played with
them, seeming to love every moment of their attention. Ahmed
walked up, a look of disgust on his face, and stopped next to
Toby.

'so... now that that's out of the way... why the hell are we
here, Toby?"


"Did you bring the equipment I asked for?"

"Yes. And." Ahmed crossed his arms and frowned, "WHY are
we here?"

Toby reached into his pocket and pulled out his epad,
tapping it awake and handing it to Ahmed without saying a
word.

After a moment Ahmed handed the tablet back and said,
disparagingly, "What is this? Fantasy art?"

"Measurements taken about an hour ago from the LIN node
in the field behind the house."

"What?!" Ahmed grabbed the tablet and expanded the
display, "Impossible."

Cyndi stood and brushed herself off. She met my gaze and
smiled and I felt myself blushing.

Ahmed tapped furiously at the pad and then handed it
back. "Impossible." He pulled out his own tablet, firing it
up, and started taking measurements.

Cyndi stepped up to Toby and held out her hand. He handed
her his pad and she started scrolling through screens. "Huh...
wow... Oh my god!" Her eyes went wide and she looked at Toby.
"Tell me these are projections."


"No, because that would be a lie."



Ahmed said, "But the density... it's..."

"Unmeasureable, at least with these crappy monitors.
That's why I wanted you here... both of you."

Cyndi asked, "I understand why you"d want Ahmed, but why
me?"

Toby pointed at my truck. "That truck has a complete,
high-tech mobile veterinary clinic in it. Including a a top-
of-the-line portable medical Nuoun generator."


Ahmed and Cyndi stared at my truck for a moment.


"Harmonics?" Ahmed asked. Toby nodded.

"But I thought you explored those... back in the early
prototype days." Cyndi chimed in.

"We did, but we only tested the normal progressions... THIS
generator is exactly 17 points away."

"17?" Ahmed shook his head, "That's ridiculous. We have
no evidence of a resonance shell at 17 pi."


"Well... now we do."


Cyndi asked, 'so you discovered this by accident?"

Toby smiled and gestured at me. "He did." Toby frowned
then and said, "Oh, I"m so sorry... Cyndi, this is my brother
Will."

Cyndi turned and met my gaze, holding out her hand. 'so
good to meet you, Will! Toby's told me a lot about you."

"Yeah... I mean yes... I mean likewise..." I felt like a
schoolboy, flustered by her beauty. I did manage to shake her
hand firmly, and prayed that my hand wasn"t as sweaty as it
felt. "I... forgot that the generator was in there."

"Amazing." She smiled. "Do you mind if I take some
measurements?"


"Not at all... I figured that was why Toby wanted you here.
Anything you need..." I let go of her hand, blushed again, and
shut up.

"Thank you." Cyndi gazed at me for a moment longer and
then turned toward the Land Rover. "Come on, guys... we"ve got
work to do."

The dogs followed the three of them as they headed for
the vehicle. I saw that Frank was watching Ahmed carefully,
pushing Fezzik away when he got too close. Ahmed, preoccupied
as he was, didn"t seem to notice.

Cyndi did notice, however. She paused as she was
assembling some equipment and watched Frank. Then she turned,
met my gaze, and smiled.


Of course I blushed and had to look away.

'she's quite beautiful, for a human." Tumnus whispered
from top of the porch steps.

"Yeah... she is... and I"m acting like a teenager..." I
whispered back.


"Well, I"m sure she finds that endearing."


"Yeah, right." I shook my head. "Endearing."

Tumnus looked at me for a moment and then asked, "Will
they be staying for dinner?"

"Very likely. I imagine they may stay for a couple of
days."

"Very good sir... do you feel they will be okay with my
stews, or should we make some other arrangement?"

"I know Ahmed is a vegetarian, and I"m sure Cyndi will be
able to adapt." I watched them work. "I can"t imagine either
of them objecting to your wonderful cooking."


"Very good, sir." Tumnus paused again and then said, "Is
there anything I can do for you, sir?"

"No, thank you, Tumnus, other than keeping an eye out for
Nix and the others... though I"m sure they"ll keep their
distance with strangers around."


"What will you do while they"re working?"

"Maybe I"ll start poking at the still again. There was
some nasty gloop in the bottom..." I rolled up my sleeves, "I
think some manual labor will do me some good."

"If I may ask a favor, sir... please be sure to collect
this "goop"... it may be part of Hylonome's concoctions."

"Do you have any more of those ceramic jugs? And a
funnel, perhaps?"

"Oh yes, of course... I"ll fetch them for you
straightaway."


"Thank you, Tumnus."

He watched me watching the visitors for a moment and then
headed back into the house. I stood there for a while longer,
trying not to stare at Cyndi, and then sighed and headed for
the Still House, feeling lonelier than I had for a very long
time.


# Schemes

I spent the day mucking out the still. When I first got
in there my hair stood on end, and when I touched the still a
spark of electricity zapped my hand. I kept getting shocked
until I put on my gloves, which, of course, I promptly ruined
as I started scraping and shoveling the goop covering the
bottom of the still.

By late afternoon I had cleared two and a half large
jugfulls of the stuff, and the bottom of the still looked
clean enough for a final rinse. I removed my gloves and
promptly received an even stronger shock... one that caused my
arm to jerk back.

"Ow! What the hell...?" I shook my hand, which tingled for
a moment, and put my gloves back on.

I closed everything up, capped the ceramic jugs and
placed them to the side of the still, and stood, stretching my
aching shoulders and back. I was worn out, so I decided to
leave the final wash for another day. I took some time at the
sink with the hand-pump washing off the worst of the gunk and
rinsing out my gloves, which I hung on the side of the sink to
dry.

I emerged from the Still House as the sun fell below the
trees. Fezzik bounded over to greet me, covered in twigs and
dirt. I caught some movement out of the corner of my eye and
turned to see something large moving off into the woods behind
the barn.


"Hey Fezzik! Have a good day with Moose?"

Fezzik slurped my hand and then turned and ran toward the
house, looking back at me to make sure I was following.


"Oh, I get it... you"re hungry."


We reached the farmhouse and I spotted Toby, Ahmer, and
Cyndi sitting around the kitchen table, comparing screens and
diagnostics across several complicated-looking devices.
Tumnus was at the stove, preparing the evening's meal.

We came in to the kitchen and Ahmer stiffened, eyeing
Fezzik but not saying anything.

"Fezzik, bed." I pointed and he ran into the living room,
curling up on his large dog bed. Ahmer relaxed and gave me a
weak smile.


Toby chimed in, "Hey bro! How's the still?"


"Mucked." I turned to the sink. 'sorry for the smell."


"Actually, it's kind of nice... earthy." Cyndi said.

I turned and smiled, took a breath, and replied, "Perhaps
I"ll find a way to market it... "eu du Muck"... with a "que" at
the end."


'sounds enticing." She smiled and winked.

I couldn"t think of anything to say. I blushed and
mumbled "yeah...", turning to wash the my hands properly.

Ahmer jumped right back into the conversation I had
interrupted, 'so anyway... the resonance levels are commensurate
with..."

The rest was incomprehensible gibberish, so I finished
washing and then helped Tumnus set the table. I fed Frank and
Fezzik, though I had to call Frank in from his spot under the
Node. As soon as he was done he drank some water and headed
back out to the field.


"Tumnus... when did Frank go back to watching the node?"

"Master Tobias and his friends had quite a lot of
equipment set up around the node... but as soon as it was clear
Frank headed straight back."


The scientists continued their intense conversation
through the meal, though each of them paused to compliment
Tumnus for his excellent stew. I sat silently, smiling when
Cyndi or Toby apologized for not including me, which they both
did fairly frequently.

As we finished up dinner Cyndi caught my eye and said,
"Will... can I talk to you for a moment?"

"Uh... sure..." Of course my heart leapt and I blushed.
"Anything wrong?"

"No, not at all... I just have some questions about this
place... some readings that seem a bit anomalous."

We stood and Toby glanced up, smiled, and gave me the
thumbs up. Ahmer seemed annoyed at the interruption and pulled
Toby back into their conversation.

"Let's get some air." Cyndi said. "I"d love to see the
node at night."


'sure thing."

I led Cyndi out the back. She stopped in between the
house and the fence and looked around, taking a deep breath
and letting it out slowly.

"It is so beautiful here." She looked up and gestured at
the sky, "I don"t know that I"ve ever seen such bright stars."

"Light pollution." I said, and then kicked myself... of
course she"d know that. "Not a lot of people around these
parts."

"I like it." She smiled at me. "Thank you for having us
here."

"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you... and Toby wouldn"t
have let me say no even had I been so inclined."


Cyndi turned to see Frank sitting under the node. "What's



Cyndi turned to see Frank sitting under the node. "What's

Frank doing?"

"We don"t know. He's been like this all day... except when
you all were busy taking measurements."


"Is he going to sleep out here?"

"Maybe." I shrugged. "It's not a problem, I mean it's a
clear night, not too cold."

Cyndi nodded and watched Frank for a moment before
turning and catching my eye, 'so... can I ask you something?"


'sure."

"You mentioned the 'still house", and Toby filled me in.
Is there really a huge copper cauldron in there?"


'sure is. I can show it to you if you like."

"Maybe tomorrow... tell me, Will... do you know if it's
grounded?"


"I don"t know... how could I tell?"

"Is it wired to anything? For proper grounding it would
have to be wired to a long metal rod stuck into the earth."

"No, I don"t think so... at least I didn"t see any wires
like that."

"Okay, thanks." She pulled out her epad and tapped it
awake, making some notations. "And what about the barn?"


"What about it?"

"Any metal in there? Specifically conductive metal like
copper or steel."

"Yes, actually..." I wondered about how much to tell her.
The barn felt like a secret " at least Miss Thatcher treated
it so. "There's some patterns in the floor and copper
fittings, caps, and lines running throughout."



"Really? Why?"

I shrugged. "It's really quite beautiful, but other than
aesthetics I have no idea why they built it like that."


"Can I see it?"


I hesitated.

'sorry, I don"t mean to pry, it's just that there are
three separate resonance fields at play here. The strongest by
far is the Nuoun generator in your truck. The weakest is the
still, which, as a massive, ungrounded copper structure, can
produce quite a charge."


"Yeah... I felt it when I was cleaning it out."


"Really? Tell me about that."


"Just some strong static electricity..."


"How strong?"

"Well, the last one made my arm twitch..." I blushed and
shook my head, 'sorry, I"m not very technical... at least not
with electronics."

She put her hand on my arm and said, "It's okay, Will...
you"re amazing in your own way."


I felt my heart leap again and mumbled, "Thanks."

She patted my arm and smiled, "That is a very strong
discharge, by the way. In fact, I might suggest you ground the
still as soon as you can... it could get quite dangerous."


'static electricity is dangerous?"

"If left on it's own, under certain conditions... it can
build up enough energy to kill a man. Do you know what a
capacitor is?"



"Vaguely... something about storing electricity?"

"Exactly. You have to be extra careful when dealing with
capacitors, especially the big ones they use for high voltage
equipment... even unplugged they can built up a charge from
ambient electricity. Tesla theorized that you could capture
and utilize ambient electricity to power a city... and he was
not entirely wrong, just a little off in scale in terms of the
power needs of a modern city."


'so the still is acting like a big capacitor?"

"Exactly. It will ground itself however it can... like
through a person touching it."

"I"ll run to the hardware store tomorrow and get a... what
was it?"


"A grounding rod."

"Right." I paused and murmured a reminder into my LINC.
"Okay, so... the barn. I guess from what you said that the barn
is resonating even more than the still?"

"Exactly. If you picture the still as a big, powerful,
unchanneled energy source, the barn acts like a tuned
resonance chamber. There is no excess energy discharge...
meaning it's probably well grounded... but any charge that
passes through is amplified and reflected back."


"That's... weird."

"Yes it is. The type of passive amplification we"re
talking about is complex... not something that happens in
nature. Whomever put together these patterns you"re talking
about knew precisely what they were doing, and put them there
to amplify energy... with extraordinary efficiency and effect."


"I see."

"The resonance effect that caused the breakthrough with
this node was driven by a threefold process... the extra power
source just outside the harmonic shell, the raw "battery" of
the still which undoubtedly discharged into the resonance


the still which undoubtedly discharged into the resonance

field at regular intervals, and the amplifying patterns in the
barn."


'so... can it be replicated?"

"Yes, I think so... though not without extensive work and
detailed understanding of all components."

I thought for a moment, staring at the sky as a cloud
pass over the moon.

Cyndi said, quietly, "This is why I wanted to talk to
you. Toby said the barn is off limits... something about a
family secret... I didn"t want to pressure you to do anything
you don"t want to do."


"Toby wouldn"t pressure me."

"Don"t be too sure. He's subtle... much as I adore Toby he
can be very stubborn and manipulative when he wants to be. And
Ahmer... let's just say that Ahmer doesn"t abide tradition,
secrets, or emotional attachment when they interfere with
science..." Her voice lowered and she muttered, "...or his
personal drive for fame and glory."

I looked at Cyndi, and was struck once again by her
beauty. So strong, so smart... I took a deep breath and said,
'so you would forgo the advances that this discovery creates...
just because the barn is a secret?"

She nodded and said, "Analyzing the barn would be the
fastest way to re-create the phenomena, but we"re all smart
people. If we can"t create our own version of the passive
amplifier, then we don"t deserve to be called 'scientists". It
will just take longer..."

"How do you propose to keep the barn a secret if it's
such an integral part of what happened?"

"I was thinking about that... and I"d like to hear your
thoughts too. Basically I"d keep the barn secret but hint at
some kind of natural amplification effect outside the Nuoun
generator. The still is already factored into the equations
we"ve been discussing because Toby knew about it already.


we"ve been discussing because Toby knew about it already.

We"ll attempt to re-create this in the lab and fail... and
"discover" the key need for the amplifier in due time."

"Won"t that just beg the question, though... if you fail
until you"ve built the amplifier, won"t that cause folks to
come back, demanding to see how it happened "naturally"?"

"Possibly... I thought about that... but given a solid
success in the lab we can probably deflect such questions.
Everyone will be so caught up in what we"ve achieved I think I
can intervene if they get too nosy."


"Toby may help with that."


"Yes, and... he"ll be pissed that we hid this from him."


"Then we should tell him."

Cyndi looked at me for a moment, eyebrow raised. "Are you
sure?"

"He's my brother. If I tell him how important it is to
keep this secret, I"m sure he"ll agree. Especially if I sneak
a few diagrams to you to speed things along."

"That could work... though it might be better if I were to
create the diagrams. I can abstract the details and translate
them into standard circuit schemas, once I"ve deciphered the
patterns. That way no one will be able to trace them back. We
could tell Toby and I"m sure he"ll agree to keep the source a
secret if we have what we need to reproduce the event." She
met my gaze again and said, "Only with your permission, of
course."

"How will you explain your diagrams to other folks? Other
than Toby, I mean."

She laughed and shook her head. "They already think I"m
an insane genius... to them this will be just another "flash of
inspiration"." She saw my expression and sobered, "I don"t
think of myself that way, by the way... but when you"re founding
a company on a brand new technology, it's better to let folks
believe you have some magic. If they knew how it was all just
elbow grease and long hours they"d lose their sense of


elbow grease and long hours they"d lose their sense of

incredulity and we"d be up to our ears in competition."


"That makes sense."

Cyndi stared up at the sphere for a while and then said,
in a quiet voice, 'so... speaking of magic... what is Tumnus?"


'sorry?"

She turned to me and said in a low voice, "Tumnus. He's
not human."


"Uh..."

She smiled and said, "The Lion, The Witch, and the
Wardrobe is one of my favorite stories, second only to
Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. I knew there was something
strange about him the moment I met him, and watching him this
evening I started to see some... anomalies."


'such as."

"Well, his horns, for one. At first I thought my eyes
were playing tricks on me, but then I started seeing the way
he walks... and realized that his legs are not quite normal.
Everything else just faded into view as the evening
progressed."

I stared at her for a moment and then said, "I"m sorry...
but I don"t think it's my place to talk about this. If you"d
like to know... please ask Tumnus."

"Of course." She straighted and nodded. "I"m sorry to put
you in that position... I wasn"t thinking."


"It's no problem."

"No, it was rude. You"re perfectly correct " if I am
wondering, I should ask Tumnus. He seems like such a
wonderful, gentle being... I just don"t want to offend him."

"Then be your normal charming self, and I"m sure it will
be fine."


Cyndi laughed and then said, "Change of subject... do you
like Belgian beer?"


"It's my favorite."

She nodded, "I thought it might be. I happen to be a big
fan... and I also happen to have brought several of my favorites
with me."


"What did you bring?"


"Let's go back inside and I"ll show you..."

'sure, just a sec." I grabbed a water dish off the back
porch and headed over to Frank, swinging carefully over the
fence so I didn"t spill anything. He was lying under the node,
and he sat up as I approached. I knelt down beside him and
asked, "You okay, Frank? You thirsty?"

I put the water bowl down. He leaned against me and
slurped my face, gazing up at me in that way that melts my
heart. I held him for a moment, feeling his strong, irregular
heartbeat, and then stood. He lay back down, eyes glued to the
node.


When I got back to Cyndi she asked, "He okay?"


'seems fine, just obsessed."

We headed back into the house to discover that Toby and
Ahmer were already enjoying Cyndi's beer. We joined in, and
the rest of the evening was a blur.


# Restoration

The next morning I got up extra early and headed out to
the barn. I was uneasy about sharing it with Cyndi, but I
didn"t see any other way to ensure we kept it secret from the
others.

I let myself in, headed to the central stall, and set
things up as I had before. This time the smoke from the
lantern drifted lazily in the still air.

"My Lady... I don"t know if you"re there or you can hear
me, but... I wanted to ask you"re permission to share the
patterns in this barn with someone."

The response was distant, quiet... tired... _Do you trust
them?_

"I... do." I cleared my throat, realizing it was true.
"Yes, I do."


Then do what you must.


"I will, thank you. Can I do anything for you?"

The silence that followed was amplified by the stillness
of the barn.


"Okay, then... thank you, My Lady."

I packed everything up and headed back to the farmhouse,
still uneasy, but feeling a little better. At least the Lady
knew what I was doing.

When I got there Tumnus and Cyndi were in deep
conversation over steaming mugs " hers coffee and his tea.


"Oh, hi... sorry..." I said as I made my way to the counter
to get some coffee.


"Please, join us, Will."


"Yes, Master William... if you please."

"Okay." I poured my coffee and brought it to the table.
As I sat I asked, "What's up?"

Tumnus said in a low voice, "I have revealed my secret to
Miss Cynthia, who's acute perception saw through my ruse."

"I never want to cause you harm, or embarrassment... I
fully understand the need for secrecy in this matter." Cyndi
said, quietly, placing her hand on Tumnus" arm. "Please know I
hold you in the highest regard, and, quite frankly, I"m
honored you"re willing to share this with me."

"Well, if you put it that way..." Tumnus chuckled and
patted Cyndi's hand. "I am pleased to discontinue my
subterfuge... with present company, of course."

"Welcome to the inner circle." I said to Cyndi, who met
my gaze and nodded, her expression serious.

"I... really... thank you." She seemed almost at a loss for
words.

I heard someone coming down the stairs just as Toby's
voice called out "Is that coffee I smell?"

"Ah yes, Master Tobias... it is indeed." Tumnus leapt up
and hurried to the counter. "Please, have a seat."

A few minutes later Ahmer joined us... dressed in suit and
tie... and demanded tea. The next hour was spent sorting through
the day and deciding how best to proceed. Ahmer wanted to
finish up quickly, so right after breakfast he and Toby took
their equipment over to the field and continued taking
measurements.


Frank wandered in and I fed the dogs as Tumnus cleaned



Frank wandered in and I fed the dogs as Tumnus cleaned

up. Frank was moving a little slower than normal, so I made a
note to run some tests later that morning.


Cyndi and I headed over to the barn.

"Are you sure this is okay?" Cyndi asked as I pulled out
the key to the padlock. "I mean... Toby and Ahmer will likely be
heads-down all day, but I still don"t want to jeopardize your
family secret."


"Yes, I"m sure... I need to run some tests on Frank, so..."


"Tests? What kind of tests?"

I sighed, "He's sick... very sick, actually. A heart
condition."


"Oh, Will, I"m so sorry... he's such an amazing creature..."

"Yeah..." I sniffed and finished unlocking the door. "The
candle that burns twice as bright..."

"...burns half as long." Cyndi finished the quote.
"Bladerunner is another favorite."

"Mine to." I paused and held her gaze for a moment.
"Okay, well... here you go."


I pushed the open the door and Cyndi gasped.

"Oh my god... it's so beautiful!" She wandered in, wonder
suffusing her expression. She pulled out her epad and a
stylus. Turning back to me she said, "As promised I won"t take
any pictures... but this may take me a while."

"Take your time. Lock up when you"re done. What should I
tell them if they ask where you are?"

"Tell them I went for a stroll... to clear my mind." She
smiled, "I do that a lot."

'sounds good. Oh, right, I need to ask... my diagnostic
tools are in the truck... is it okay if I use them? I doesn"t


tools are in the truck... is it okay if I use them? I doesn"t

require the generator..."

"Of course! The process that involved your Nuoun
generator finished long before we arrived. The measurements we
have on the process come from a replay of events captured by
the Node. Feel free to use the generator, move the truck...
whatever you need. I already got everything I need from it."


"Thanks." I turned to leave.


"Will..."


"Yes?"

When I turned back she held my gaze for a moment before
murmuring, "Thank you."


"My pleasure, Cyndi. Good luck!"

She nodded and turned to the diagram on the floor in
front of her. Within moments she was engrossed, "hmm-ing" and
"huh-ing" and scribbling on her pad with her stylus.

I left, closing the door but leaving it unlatched, and
headed for the truck. I called to Frank and he came galumphing
out of the house.

It took a few minutes to verify that there was some more
fluid building up... not enough to drain, but enough to start
effecting his energy levels.

"Oh, bud-bud... looks like this place isn"t as magical as I
had hoped." I sighed and removed the gloves. Frank sat up and
looked at me, tilting his head. "You"re okay, bud... but we"re
going to have to do that little procedure again in a few
days." I noted down the time and date and saw that it had only
been a week since the last procedure. My heart sank at the
implications.

Sensing my sadness Frank got up, stepped close, and sat
down on my feet, raising his head to stare at me. I breathed
and let the sadness flow, feeling tremendous love for and from
this incredible creature. It felt like our own personal
harmonic resonance, and I let my thoughts drift away as I


harmonic resonance, and I let my thoughts drift away as I

stared into his big brown eyes.

He suddenly turned, pushing himself upright, and stared
at the house.


"What is it, Frank?"

He stood, wagging, and headed into the house. I followed
him and he went up the stairs " the first time he ever did
that " and headed for the attic stairs. He tried to climb them
but they were too steep for him.

"Whoa, bud... hang on there." Looking at the stairs I could
think of no way to get him up there... except to carry him. He
was much smaller than Fezzik, but still weighed around 100
pounds. I did some stretching, eyeing the stairs, and then
knelt, holding out my arms. "Okay bud... carry time."

Frank stepped over to me and draped himself across my
arms. I breathed in a few times and then lifted him, trying to
use my legs and not my back.

"Hoo boy... you puttin" on weight there bud-bud?" I huffed
my way up the stairs. Frank lay perfectly still, even when I
lost my balance for a moment and nearly tumbled backwards. We
reached the landing and I put him down. He barely fit, and I
had to stand on the stair to make room for him.

When I caught my breath I leaned over, knocked gently on
the door, and said "Nix? Frank wants to see you."

The door opened and I was blinded by an intense light
shining out from the center of the room. I shielded my eyes as
Frank walked into the room.

I was about to step onto the landing and follow him when
the door closed.


"Oh... okay..." I sighed and then laughed. "Got it."

An image of a tiny glowing creature with translucent
wings floated into my mind. The image zoomed in to the
creatures face, which had large brown eyes, a cute button
nose, and tiny fangs. The eyes reminded me of Frank's. The


nose, and tiny fangs. The eyes reminded me of Frank's. The

creature smiled and a feeling of warmth and gratitude washed
over me, dispelling the soreness from my muscles.


"Well... you"re welcome, of course."

The image faded and I headed back down the stairs. About
halfway down I heard some thumping from the attic, and what
sounded like a tiny voice laughing.

I headed back to the kitchen and sat down with a second
cup of coffee, my mind wandering through all I had seen and
heard. I wondered what would happen... and when we might get to
a place where boredom was my biggest concern.


# Defenses

As I sat and thought, my LINC chimed. It was my lawyer,
Richard.


"Good morning, Mr. Adkins! How are you today?"


"I am well, thanks, and you?"


"Doing fine... and the pups?"


"Boundless energy and enthusiasm... and drool, of course."

He chuckled, "Marvelous." After a moment he cleared his
throat, "I"m afraid I have some bad news..."


"Oh?"

"Mr. Keats is is suing you for damages and threatening to
press charges " assault on himself and two of his men."


"Really?"

"Claims you attacked them. It's quite serious... he's
apparently in the hospital in traction, and one of his men may
lose the use of his right arm. Is this true? Did you attack
them?"


"Absolutely not."

"Well, that's a relief... but were they attacked on your
property?"


"Well... yes they were..."


"Please explain."


"I"ll do better than that." I murmured into my LINC and
the optics told me that the recording had been uploaded to the
authorities when the Node came online two days back.
"Beautiful. Here's a reference to the official recording of
the incident which I have already registered with the
authorities." I sent Richard the reference.

"Oh? Oh... oh my. Well... this certainly puts things in a
different light." I waited while he reviewed the recording.
"Who is that rather large gentleman... oh my goodness!"


"Yeah, sorry, I should have warned you."

"My goodness... he's so fast... and strong! How did he do
that?" Richard cleared his throat, "Well that explains quite a
lot... the description of the injuries were rather astonishing,
particularly the man who came in with the barrel of his gun
wrapped around his arms. As you say, I see this has been
accepted by the authorities... I"ll review it in more detail and
submit it as evidence for dismissing the lawsuit. Where is
that large gentleman, by the way?"

"I don"t know. He ran off shortly after... though he did
spend some time playing with Fezzik before he left."

"This is a strange case... he wasn"t acting in self
defense, but rather in defense of you and your dogs. Keats is
clearly the instigator here. I"m sure they"ll absolve you as
you truly didn"t have anything to do with it... especially since
it seems you saved Keats" life toward the end of the
recording. You"d better be absolutely certain that gentleman
is nowhere near your property or you could be brought up on
charges of aiding and abetting. I have no doubt Keats will
demand they find and arrest that man once his lawsuit fails."

"Why didn"t the police come by already to arrest me? I
mean... if he's pressing charges."

"He's threatening to press charges, using that as
leverage to force your hand. Claims he won"t press charges if
you settle out of court."


"Hah! Not likely, even without the recording."


"Again, don"t underestimate him. Keats has connections "
with the police, and even with the courts. Without your
recording you would likely lose your land AND be thrown in
jail."


"I"ll keep that in mind."

"Well, I"ll follow up with the judge and the police. They
will likely want to question you... looking for anything you
know about this large gentleman who saved you. I"ll try to get
word to you as soon as I have something."


"Okay, thanks Richard! I really appreciate your help."


"You"re welcome, Mr. Adkins. Take care."

I sat back and shook my head, wondering what I was going
to do about Moose. Thinking about his made me realize how
vulnerable I was.

I pulled up some of the research I had been doing on
LINC-enabled defense and monitoring systems. I was deep into
the research when Toby and Ahmer wandered in.

"...I"m telling you the Tau-field resonance must have
negated the Slip effect." Ahmer was arguing as the entered.


"Right but... Hey Will! Seen Cyndi?"


'she said she was going for a walk... to clear her head."

"Ah, yeah... she does that a lot. So, we"re hungry, and we
were wondering if Tumnus had any more of that stew. Where is
he, by the way?"

"Actually I don"t know." I stood and stepped up to the
fridge. "The stew's here... several flavors... we could probably
just heat some up."


Ahmer smiled and said, "Grand! Let's do it."

I pulled out a jug at random, took it over to the stove,
and filled a pot. 'say, Toby, I was wondering... what do you


and filled a pot. 'say, Toby, I was wondering... what do you

know about LINC-enabled defenses?"

'some, though Ahmer will be able to tell you a lot more...
he's the machine intelligence expert. Why?"

"We"ve got problems with hunters around here. Apparently
they"ve been hunting our property for a while... Miss Thatcher
made me promise that I wouldn"t allow that, and since the
property is so big..."


"How big is it?" Ahmer asked.

'six square miles. Part of the original subdivision of
the land before Maine was even a state."

Ahmer whistled. "Yeah, you"ll need some monitoring... I"d
say probably twenty or so UHR infrared systems with ident-
enabled trackers. Maybe some drones as well..."


"That sounds perfect... but""


"Free." Toby interrupted, anticipating my question.

"Free?" Ahmer said, "Nonesense, those systems cost" OW!
You HIT me!"

"Kicked, actually." Toby said and smiled. "Bro... this land
belongs to our family. Sure you"re the primary caretaker, but
I"d be remiss if I didn"t step in to help out."


"But you"ve already helped out with the node."

"And look what that did, hmmm? We broke through the
barriers we"ve been struggling with for a decade! We gained
more here in the last few days than we could possibly give
back. The defense systems are a pittance compared to what
you"ve done for us."

"That's true." Ahmer admitted, nodding, "We do owe you a
lot."

"It's settled, then. Ahmer, how long would it take for
your contacts in the defense department to come through with


your contacts in the defense department to come through with

some of those prototypes?"

"A week, probably, maybe a little more. They"ll take
convincing."

"Then convince them. You"re good at that. Tell them
they"re protecting an experimental prototype node that will
change the face of technology forever... and give them full
credit for doing their part in creating the future in the
press releases."


"Wow... that's good." I said.


"Yep, that's most of my job these days... fancy words."

"Will, Toby's comment reminded me that I want to thank
you." Ahmer said, "For letting us crawl all over your home and
make a nuisance of ourselves. It really is quite
extraordinary... and the most interesting thing that's happened
in quite some time."

"You are most welcome, Ahmer... and thank you for your
patience with my dogs."

"Well... Frank is wonderful... He helps me understand why
people like dogs so much." Amer paused for a moment and then
asked, "Why was he sitting under the node much of yesterday...
and where is he, by the way?"

"Uh... hmmm... I"m not sure." I realized I had left Frank up
in the attic. I didn"t know if he could come down the stairs...
"Here, watch the stew for me. It should be ready in a few
minutes."

I handed the spoon to Toby, wiped my hands and headed up
to the attic stairs. When I got there the door opened and
Frank stepped out, wagging hopefully.


"There you are bud-bud... can you come down?"

Frank looked at the stairs, put a paw on the first one,
whined, and backed up.



I sighed, and did some stretching. "Okay, boy, here I""

Frank floated up into the air, looking as surprised as I
felt, and floated gently down to land next to me.

"Well... thank you, Nix." I breathed in and sent thoughts
of love and gratitude. The smiling face flashed across my
mind.


"Come on, Frank... Ahmer wants to say hi."

Frank headed down the hall and bounced down the stairs,
heading straight into the kitchen.

"Hey Frank!" Toby said. Ahmer murmured something that I
didn"t catch, and when I to to the kitchen there was Frank,
leaning against Amher, gazing up at him while Ahmer scratched
his chest.

"You are quite a handsome devil." Ahmer said and Frank
slurped at his face, missing by a hair's breadth. "But I think
I"ll ask you not to lick my face, hmm?"

Frank closed his mouth and tilted his head. Ahmer paused
and they gazed at each other for a moment. Amer murmured, "How
in the world did you understand that?"

'stew's ready!" Toby announced and started dishing out
bowls. I gestured to Frank to head to his bed, and he stood
and trotted into the living room.


"Amazing." Ahmer said, shaking his head.


"That's Frank." I said, feeling like a proud father.

We sat down and enjoyed another delicious meal courtesy
of Tumnus.

About halfway through the meal Toby leaned over to Ahmer
and said, "Uh... you"ve been Franked."


"I have? Where?" Ahmer looked down at his suit.


"Right there." Toby pointed to a small dark stain on his
shoulder. "And there." There was another stain on his sleeve.


Ahmer sighed and shook his head. "Ah, the price of love."

We all laughed. I spotted Frank lying on his bed, his
tongue slipping out of his mouth to rest on the floor. I felt
my heart sink once again, and excused myself from the table.
Toby and Ahmer didn"t seem to notice as they dove back into
their technical debate.


# Dreams and Departures

I stood at the sink cleaning my bowl and spoon when Cyndi
came in through the side door.


"Hey Cyndi!" Toby said, "Have a good walk?"


'sure did. It's beautiful out here... so peaceful."


"Where's you go?"

"Oh, around." She waved her hand vaguely. "Not too deep
into the woods, but enough to get a sense of the place." She
stepped over to me and put her hand on my arm, murmuring,
"How's Frank?"


"Okay..." I took a deep breath. "He's okay."

She looked at me for a moment and then nodded. Turning
she spotted Frank and walked over to him. He lifted his head
as she sat on the floor next to him. He put his paw on her leg
and rested his head on her thigh. She sat there rubbing his
head and neck, looking down at him with a solemn expression.

I needed to change the subject. 'so Toby... how did you and
Ahmer come up with the theories behind the LINternet?"

Toby chuckled. "Well... I know this sounds hokey, but... it
came to me in a dream."


"Really?"

"Yeah. I still remember it clearly. This incredibly hot
chick""


"Toby." Cynthia spoke up without looking away from Frank.



"Oh, sorry..."


"I think that warrants a donation."


"Chick? Really?"


"It's like saying "This really hung stud"."

"Hey! I didn"t say she was stacked or anything... though of
course she was..." Toby winked at me.

"I think... five hundred to the battered woman's shelter in
Atlanta Georgia."

"Okay, fine... I"ll make it a thousand "cause of the
stacked comment."


"Good. Thank you."

Toby murmured into his LINC. I turned to Ahmer and asked,
"Do you have any idea what that was all about?"

Ahmer nodded, "In an attempt to bring your brother out of
the misogynistic dark ages, Cynthia has made him agree to
donate to a cause of her choice every time he chooses words of
a... questionable nature."


"Wow. That's ingenious."


"Yes, and it works... mostly."

"Mostly." Toby chimed in. "I still slip up every once in
a while. In all honesty I"m grateful, though... I have lot of
people looking to me as a leader, and Cyndi's helped me clean
up my act. I never intend to hurt anyone, I just... don"t seem
to recognize when I"m doing it sometimes. I"ve gotten so much
better now that I even get invited to women's charity events."
His eyes twinkled.

"Go ahead, elaborate. I"m sure there's another good cause
just waiting for a donation." Cyndi said.


"Nah, I"ll let that one go." Toby turned back to me, 'so



"Nah, I"ll let that one go." Toby turned back to me, 'so

it was a... beautiful woman who came to me in a dream and told
me about N-Space manipulations... well, not in so many words. It
was more like she showed me what they were..."

"How can you see something like that? I mean... aren"t we
limited to visualizing in three dimensions or something?"

"Four including time, but yeah, normally... somehow she
helped me visualize it. Hey, it was a dream, you know? Enough
stuck with me that I took the concept and ran with it." He
sighed. "I still have dreams about her, but none so vivid."

"What was her name?" Tumnus spoke up from the doorway. He
had entered so quietly I hadn"t heard him.

"Tumnus! Good to see you, man. We just finished up
lunch..." Toby rubbed his belly. 'so good."

"I"m pleased you enjoyed it." Tumnus" expression didn"t
change. "Please, Master Tobias... do you remember her name."


'sure... her name was Tia." Toby frowned, "Why?"


"I was just wondering. Visitations like that are rare..."


"Visitations? What do you mean?"

"I beg your pardon, sirs and madam... I"ve spoken out of
turn." He turned walked over the the stove where the pot of
stew still bubbled.

"No really, Tumnus... tell us what you mean." Toby leaned
forward and rested his arms on the table. "It sounds
important."

Tumnus sighed and turned around. "It's a belief my people
have, going back many generations... when you see someone in
your dreams who makes such an impression that you vividly
remember them for years... then in fact you were visited by...
something or someone."

"That sounds cool... and creepy." Toby said, "Is there
more?"


"Not that I"d care to share at the moment. It's steeped
in folklore and myth, with more than a little superstition."

'sounds precisely like superstition to me. Next we"ll
start talking about magic." Ahmer said, frowning.

"Perhaps it's best if you think of it that way, and
forgive my intrusion." Tumnus turned back and continued
cleaning up.

Cyndi caught my eye and raised an eyebrow. I shrugged and
shook my head.

Cindy said, 'so, boys, got anything for me? Any new
discoveries or revelations while I was strolling about?"


"Well, we did finish our measurements..."

As they launched into another energetic conversation, I
stepped up next to Tumnus, and saw that his hands were
shaking.


I murmured, "Are you okay, Tumnus?"

"Yes... thank you Master William." He lowered his voice to
a whisper. "I"ll be fine. It's just that... all these things
happening so fast... and I still can"t find Nix..."


"Nix is up in her bedroom."


"What?!" Tumnus said a little louder than he wanted.

'sO what was that about the refraction field?" Cyndi said
in a loud voice, standing and walking over to the table.


'sorry..." Tumnus whispered, "That is wonderful news!"

"And she's already had a visit from Frank. Didn"t want me
up there, but I understand."


"Did you... get anything from her? Any... images?"


"Yes. A smiling, cherubic face. Oh, and a tiny glowing
creature with iridescent wings."

Tumnus hung his head. After a moment I saw he was crying.
I put my hand on his and he gripped it tightly, his little
nails digging into my skin.


"Why don"t you go up and see her? I"ll finish up here."

"Oh Master William... thank you." He nodded, wiped his
nose, and headed quickly through the living room, stepping
carefully over Frank, who sprawled out after Cyndi left him.

As I finished cleaning up and putting away the leftover
stew Toby said, 'so, bro... we"ve got all we need... Ahmer and
Cyndi are heading out."

Ahmer smiled, stood, and held out his hand. "Thank you
again, William... it was a pleasure to see you. I really
appreciate you letting us descend upon you like this."

I dried my hands and grasped his firmly, "The honor and
pleasure is all mine, Ahmer. Come back anytime."

He glanced over his shoulder at Frank and said, "I might
do just that."


"Good. See you soon, I hope."

Cyndi, Ahmer and Toby headed upstairs to pack. With
everyone bustling around, Cyndi didn"t have a chance to talk
with me until Ahmer and Toby were packing up the Land Rover.

She stepped up beside me on the porch, backpack in hand,
and murmured, "Is Tumnus okay?"


"Yeah, he was just overwhelmed."

"Well we"re leaving so we"ll be out of his hair... and
yours."

"Cyndi, it's been a true pleasure." My heart beat fast as
I added, "Would you... consider visiting again sometime?"


"I would love that. I will as soon as I can." She smiled
and held out her arms. "Hug?"

I stepped in and we hugged. I stepped back and said
quietly, "Did you get what you needed from the barn?"

'sure did. It's ingenious. There are a few redundancies
that I don"t quite understand, but I figure we"ll recreate it
as-is and go from there. Don"t fix what ain"t broke, as my
grandpa used to say."


"Wise man. Take care, Cyndi."

"You too, Will. Please tell Tumnus thanks... for
everything... especially for his trust."


"I will."

Cyndi headed out to the Land Rover, argued for a minute
with Ahmer, who threw up his hands and climbed into the
passenger seat. Cyndi turned toward me and winked. I waved and
laughed as she climbed into the drivers seat.

Toby strolled up as they drove off. "Well... that went
really well I think."


"They"re amazing."


"C"mon bro... Ahmer's annoying... Cyndi's amazing."


"True..."

'she really likes you. I"ve never seen her warm up to
someone as fast. I mean, she flirts a lot, and uses her charm
and beauty to her best advantage, but she let her guard down
with you real quick."


"Well, I like her too."

"Really? I mean... I couldn"t tell what with your puppydog
eyes and how tongue tied you were."



"Thanks, Toby... you"re a real pal."

"Hey, it was cute!" I punched him in the shoulder, "Ow!
But seriously... I don"t think I"ve ever seen you go so gaga
over anyone like that before."


"Do you know anyone else like Cyndi?"

He shook his head, "Not in a million years. She's one-of-
a-kind."


"There you go then."


"Bro... I hate to do this to you... but she's engaged."

"Oh, I would be shocked if she weren"t spoken for."
Despite my bravado I felt my heart sink.


"Man's an ass. Doesn"t deserve her."


"And I suppose I do?"

"Damn right you do! You"re an incredible human being,
Will... and you deserve someone just as special."


"Well... she's spoken for."


"We"ll see about that." Toby smiled mischievously.


"Toby... what are you talking about?"


"Oh, nothing."


"Toby, come on! I know that look."

"Oh really?" His expression changed to one of hurt
innocence. "What look?"


"The "I"ve got a plan" look."


"I don"t know what you"re talking about."


"Okay... just... just don"t do anything to hurt Cyndi."


Toby turned and put his hands on my shoulders. "Will, I
will never, ever do anything to hurt Cyndi. Hell, I"ve been in
love with her for decades... it was obvious from the start we
were not compatible, plus I was married when we met... but I
would do anything for her. Just like I"d do anything for you,
bro."


"I..." I felt myself tearing up, "Thank you, Toby."

"Remember that, Will. No matter what... I"m here for you."
He gave me a big hug.


"I know. You always have been."

"Now... the good-bad news..." He sighed and stepped back, "I
have to go too."


"What? Why?"

"Duty calls. We"ve got to get cranking on this discovery.
If we can roll it out before first quarter next year we"ll
leave our competition so far in the dust they"ll never
recover."

"Okay, well... it was great seeing you. Please come on back
soon."

"I will, bro, I promise." He gave me another hug and then
turned to go. "Oh wait, I almost forgot... Sam called yesterday
and wanted me to ask you to call her."


"Why didn"t she call me herself?"

"I told her you were really busy... and she's going to ask
if she can come visit. I wanted to give you some breathing
room before having someone else here." He smiled, 'she's so
excited to see you, and she's heard so much about the Thatcher
homestead it's a thing of legend for her now. Plus she's
studying ornithology, so she's going to want to wander the
woods like we used to."

"I"d be happy to have her here. I"ll call her later
today. She still at Yale?"


"Yep, senior year, can you believe it?" He shook his
head. "Time flies."


'sure does. Take care, Toby."

"You too, bro. And thank Tumnus for me... I hope he's okay.
He seemed pretty upset."

"I think all the chaos and people got to him. He's a
trooper, he"ll be fine... probably needs a few days of quiet. He
did spend quite a few years here all by himself."

"Makes sense. Tell him I"m sorry for anything I did to
contribute to his stress... he's a good man."


"He sure is."

Toby turned back and headed to his car. As he climbed in
the lights came on, and as the door swung shut the car turned
around slowly. Toby was busy sorting through papers, not even
watching where the car was going. I raised my hand and waved
as he pulled down the drive and headed off, silent but for the
sound of tires crunching on gravel.

I lowered my hand slowly, mind full of many things. Frank
came up behind me and pushed his head under my hand. I looked
down and scritched his nose.


"Looks like it's just us again, bud-bud."

Frank gazed up at me, big brown eyes full of wisdom and
love.


# Commitment

About an hour after they departed I got a set of forms
and a note from Ahmer's administrative assistant. The forms
required some research to complete, so I spent the afternoon
sitting at the kitchen table with a beer signing NDAs and
requisition agreements using my LINC ident.

As the sun was settling below the treeline, Tumnus came
down from the attic. He looked exhausted, but smiled warmly at
me as he came into the kitchen.


"Master William, thank you again."


"My pleasure, Tumnus... are you okay?"

"I am fine now, thanks to you. Nix is in fine fettle..." He
shook his head, a look of amazement on his face, 'she's... she's
regained most of her magic."


"That's incredible! Did she show you how it happened?"

'she didn"t really know, other than the fact that the
node of yours acts like an ancient Tether tree." He saw my
confusion and said, "My apologies... there's a lot more to it
but you can think of a Tether tree as a font of magic, drawing
energy from the center of the multiverse. When enough Tether
trees gather together they form what is called a Heartwood.
Faeries hatch from seeds of the Tether trees in the center of
the Heartwood, and their tree provides a home for them where
they can rest, replenish, and heal."

"That sounds like the dryads in Human lore... or maybe it
was naiads?"

Tumnus smiled and said, "Most closely related to Dryads
of the Oak, yes, though the Faeries are not physically bound


of the Oak, yes, though the Faeries are not physically bound

to their tree and are much, much more powerful."

I thought for a moment, remembering more folk tales, and
added, "We have a myth of a tree as well " Yggdrasil " that
lives at the heart of the Norse universe, linking their
legendary Nine Worlds together..."

Tumnus raised an eyebrow, "Do you believe in such
things?"


"I"m starting to, now..."


He nodded and smiled. "Good. Very good."


'so Nix showed you that the node healed her?"

"Yes. She... found her way inside it and it quickly
restored her magic."


"Inside? How?"

Tumnus shook his head, "I don"t know. She didn"t seem
capable of passing through the barrier Master Tobias put
around the Node... she must have found another way in. She
showed me an image of her asleep, floating inside a vast,
complex weave of light within the node."

"Huh... that must have been why Frank was so obsessed with
it. He must have known somehow that Nix was inside."


"That makes good sense. Mr. Frank never ceases to amaze."


I nodded and asked, 'so, Nix is fully recovered?"

"Not yet... she has her magic back but it will take some
time for her to regain her powers." He paused and tugged at
his beard, "Think of it as recovering from a long,
debilitating injury. It will take time for her "magic muscles"
to grow back."


"Anything I can do to help?"


Tumnus gazed at me and smiled, "You have already done so



Tumnus gazed at me and smiled, "You have already done so

much, Master William, in the short time you"ve been here. Done
the impossible, really... even the Lady had no idea how to cure
her Faeries. Now... I think we just have to wait, be patient,
and respond should Nix need anything."

"Of course! Though I really don"t feel I"ve done
anything... it all seems like a fortuitous accident."

"The way of Destiny." Tumnus said, "You were meant to be
here. The fact that you brought Frank " a wondrous beast in
his own right " meant that you needed the Node. Placing the
Node opened the way for Nix's healing... and introducing her to
Frank opened the way for you and she to connect..." He shook his
head, "The multiverse works in mysterious ways."


"It sure does."

"Now... are you hungry, Master William? I think I"d like to
prepare a special stew, by way of thanks, but that may take an
hour or so."

"Yes I am, and I"m happy to wait if I get the chance to
taste another of your specialties."

"You are very kind to say so, sir. If you"ll excuse me,
I"ll get right to it."

I nodded and stood, heading out back for a breath of
early evening air. Frank followed me outside, turning to look
up at the attic as we neared the fence.

I looked up and saw a bright glow moving around behind
the curtains. Frank wagged and sat, staring up at the attic
windows.

I heard something moving in the woods beyond the field.
Gazing in that direction I saw a large shape approaching
through the brush, and Fezzik suddenly appeared, bounding out
of the bushes. He crossed the grassy surround and leapt the
fence easily, but veered around to give the Node a wide berth.

This time Moose stepped into the clearing and raised his
hand. I waved back and he nodded, turning as something came up
behind him. He stepped to the side, revealing a tall, broad-


behind him. He stepped to the side, revealing a tall, broad-

shouldered woman with long white hair moving toward us with a
strange, swaying gait. She wore what looked like an armored
leather vest covering her impressive chest and long, lean
upper torso. Her muscular shoulders and arms were bare.

When she cleared the bushes I saw that she was a
Centauress, her beautiful equine features cast in a stern
expression, long white hair flowing down her back to drape
across her horselike lower torso. Her fur was dark red tinged
with silver, which seemed to glow in the fading light.

I turned to face them and bowed, heart racing. Frank
turned as well, sat next to me and watched as the Centauress
stepped up beside Moose and stopped. When it became clear that
they were not going to approach me, I sighed and started
walking.

Fezzik pulled up short as he neared the farmhouse side of
the fence, dancing around as I swung over. Frank stopped at
the fence and whined, alerting me to the fact that he wasn"t
able to jump over.

I was concerned about taking too much time, but it felt
important to bring Frank with me, and to not rush things, so I
headed over to the gate and Frank followed me on the other
side of the fence, stepping through when I opened the gate for
him.

As we walked across the field I breathed and cleared my
mind, focusing on my sense of wonder and honor at meeting a
real, live Centaur.

"It's like all my dreams and fantasies from childhood are
coming true." I murmured, holding on to that feeling as we
passed near the node.

The Centauress walked over to meet us on the other side
of the fence, close enough to speak but not close enough to
touch. I could see her tensing and relaxing her legs and arms,
shifting back-and-forth slightly.

I stopped on the other side and said, "You must be
Hylonome. It is an honor to meet you."


She shook her head and gestured at the Node. "Are you
responsible for that?"


"Yes."

She frowned and then pointed at the Still House, "And did
I hear Tumnus correctly when he spoke of you removing years
worth of base from the still?"

"Yes, again." I bowed my head, "I apologize if that
caused you any trouble. That was not my intent."

She harumphed and replied, "Ignorance is not an excuse.
You should have left alone what you did not understand."

I bristled slightly at her tone, but then remembered
Tumnus saying that Hylonome was a bit ornery. "Well, then I
apologize again. I would like very much if you could help
dispel some of my ignorance... and I"d like to make amends for
whatever harm I may have caused."

She stared at me for a moment and then shook her head
again, causing her hair to flow down her back like a white
silk curtain. She nodded toward the Node, "What is this
thing?"

"It allows us to communicate with each other over long
distances. They call it a Node."


"How does it work?"

"I"m afraid that I don"t know the answer to that, suffice
to say it involves some kind of folding of multidimensional
space."

'so you infect our home with something you do not
understand? Your ignorance is breathtaking in scope, and the
harm you have caused may well destroy us."

Frank barked, once, startling both Hylonome and me. I
looked down to see him scowling at Hylonome.


"What?" Hylonome said, staring at Frank, who stood,



"What?" Hylonome said, staring at Frank, who stood,

stepped between us, and barked again. "Is that so?" She raised
an eyebrow and looked back at me. "Tell me of Nix."

"Well... apparently this Node acts like a Tether tree...
Tumnus was just explaining it to me."


"Go on."

"I don"t know how " ignorance again, of course " but
somehow Nix found a way inside... rested there for a day or so...
and emerged with her magic restored."

'she... what?" Hylonome stepped back, eyes wide. "That's
impossible."

"Yet it's true." I turned to gesture at the attic windows
where the brilliant light still danced. 'see? That's Nix."


"Nix..." Hylonome muttered, staring at the farmhouse.


Frank barked again and sat on my feet, facing Hylonome.

"I see... well..." Hylonome turned back to me, her voice
softening slightly, "I may have misjudged the situation
somewhat, though not the danger your ignorance puts us in."

"Then teach me." I opened my arms, palms facing her.
"Teach me so I can be a healer and support you and the others.
That is my deepest desire."


She stared at me, brow furrowed.

"The Lady has asked me to help her people escape their
enslavement. I have no idea how to do that, but I want to...
with all my heart." I breathed and opened my mind, letting go
of my frustration and focusing on my promise. I let my
feelings flow freely " my fear for the Lady and her people, my
fear of the unknown, and my very real excitement around
helping however I could.

Hylonome's expression softened again and she said, "Will
you abide by my rules, pay heed to what I say, and act as I
command?"



"To a point, yes."

"Then no." She frowned and drew back, crossing her arms.
"I will not teach you."

"Hear me out, Hylonome. I hesitate only because there are
other obligations I must attend to. There are some beings
here... such as Frank and Fezzik... and my family... who I will not
harm in any way through action or inaction. My commitment to
the Lady is real and is as complete as it can be, but it is
NOT in lieu of my other commitments to my loved ones." I drew
myself up and stared into her eyes. "I commit to listening and
learning with an open mind, and to doing all you ask... provided
it does not endanger those I love."

She held my gaze for a long time. I could almost feel her
digging around in my mind. Finally she nodded, once, and for
the first time a small smile played over her lips.

"Thank you." I breathed a sigh of relief, feeling the
tension drain from my shoulders.

She turned and headed back to the woods, speaking over
her shoulder, "We start on the morrow... first light. You will
repair the damage you"ve done to the still under my close
supervision." She paused at the edge of the forest. "Meet me
there and do not be late."


"I will, Hylonome."

She harumphed again and headed off into the woods, silver
tail swishing.

Moose grinned at me and nodded before turning and heading
off to wherever he spent his nights.

I looked down at Frank and said, "What did you say to
her, bud-bud?" He wagged and shook his head, "Whatever it was...
thanks. I think you saved us."

He stood and did a little dance-step. I laughed and we
turned, heading back to the gate.



"Come on, Fezzik... dinner time."

Fezzik bounded after us and together we headed in for the
night.


# Authority

The next morning Tumnus insisted on getting up with me
before dawn and fixing me a large breakfast.

"You never know what Hylonome might ask of you... best to
be fit and ready."

I pushed back my plate and sighed, wiping my face with my
napkin. "Well, I am as ready as I"ll ever be. That was
wonderful, as always, Tumnus."

He smiled and said, "Now off you go... and do be careful.
Hylonome can be a bit... brusque, but her hearts are in the
right place."

I made a mental note of "hearts" and headed to the still.
I opened it up and went inside, picking up my gloves and
working the stiff leather.

"Good. You can follow simple orders." Hylonome stepped
into the Still House, her hooves clicking against the stone
floor. "Now let's see if you aren"t as useless as you seem."

I took a deep breath and let that go. "What would you
have me do?"

She regarded me for a moment and then nodded, a faint
smile flashing across her face. "First..."

What followed was a long list of tasks, most of which
made no sense to me. The morning passed, and Hylonome worked
me hard. She did answer a few of my questions, and by the time
I was done I understood a little more about how this "base"
provided the foundation for her concoctions.


I think I managed not to offend her too much, though I



I think I managed not to offend her too much, though I

needed to spend a fair amount of energy just breathing and
letting go of her taunts and abrasive comments.

As we parted company she stood there for a moment,
towering over me, arms crossed. Once again I felt as if she
were rummaging through my mind. I breathed and relaxed,
closing my eyes and opening my mind and heart. After two
breaths I actually managed to let go of the rest of my
frustration and let back in some of the wonder and honor I
felt in Hylonome's presence.

"I... see." She said, softly, stamping one foot on the
ground. "Yes..."

I opened my eyes and regarded her. I immediately saw many
details that I had missed " she was much older than I first
thought, and there were scars on her arms and face that I
hadn"t noticed before. She looked tired... worn out... and there
was a haunted aspect to her eyes that I hadn"t seen. My heart
went out to her as I realized she was just as frightened as I
was about what was going on with the Fae... probably more so,
because she understood it much better.

I breathed into this newfound perspective and breathed
out, letting my defenses down and welcoming her into my heart.

"Not... yet." She whispered, her brow furrowed. "But thank
you."


I bowed my head and she turned and cantered off.

I was exhausted and my shoulders ached, but I ultimately
felt good about the morning. I headed back to the house and
was washing my hands at the sink when a patrol car pulled into
my driveway.

Frank walked out onto the porch with me, and to my
surprise Fezzik came out of the living room. They sat on
either side of me as the officer got out of his car, pushed
his nightstick into it's holder at his belt, and then strolled
up to us.


"Afternoon, Mr. Adkins."



"Afternoon, Officer, how can I help you?"

"Well..." He looked around at the various buildings. From
his vantage he couldn"t see the node floating in the field,
for which I was thankful. I had a feeling that anything out of
the ordinary might cause trouble. "You"re aware of the assault
on Mr. Keats and his men?"

"Yes sir." I shook my head, "It was due to a tragic
misunderstanding... but I"m sure you know that I took no part in
the assault nor did I condone it."

"Yep, we got that from your recording." He stared up at
me for a moment and said, "You"ve got one fancy LINC there."

"Yes sir. My brother works for Livestream... he gave me
this as a present."

"Uh huh." The officer turned and gestured at the barn and
Still House. "Anyone live in those?"

"Oh no, sir. Barn's been empty forever... and the Still
House is full of... well... the still."


"Mind if I take a look?"


"May I ask why?"

He turned and regarded me for a moment. "You"re aware of
the assault... so you must be aware of the man responsible."

"Aware only that I saw what he did." I took a breath and
added, "He ran off shortly after the deed was done."

"Tell me what happened... in your own words." He took out a
pad of paper and a pen.

"Well... let's see... it was close to a week ago, we had just
arrived, and Mr. Keats and his men drove up..."

I told the story exactly as it happened, making sure to
point out how the large man arrived with Keats. When I was
done the officer underlined a few things and looked up at us.



"That Fezzik?" He pointed at Frank.


"No sir... that's Frank. Fezzik's the big one."

"Right." He peered at Fezzik who stared back, unblinking,
and started growling... a low rumble I could feel through my
shoes.

"Fezzik, leave it." Fezzik stopped immediately and looked
up at me. I made the gestures for down and stay and he
promptly dropped, placing his head on his paws. He still
stared at the officer but was no longer growling.


"Impressive control."

"When you have giant breed dogs, you need to be extra
careful."

He nodded and made another note in his notepad. 'so, do
you know where this big man is?"


"No."


"Is he on your property?"


"Not to my knowledge."

The officer looked at me for a moment and then said, "Are
you sure?"

"Well... it's a fairly big plot of land. I haven"t combed
it thoroughly, but... there's nowhere a person could live
comfortably. I"ve never seen any lights or smoke from a
campfire, so unless he's eating raw deer, or maybe roots and
things, and skulking about staying hidden... I doubt he's here."

"We"re going to have to comb the property." He made a
final note in his notepad and put it away. "There's a warrant
out for his arrest."

'sure, I understand. I might suggest you bring a few
folks to help... like I said, it's a large plot of land."


He nodded and gestured toward the barn. "Can I take a
look in there now?"

'sure." I gestured for Frank and Fezzik to go to their
beds and followed them as they went inside, "let me just go
get my keys."

Tumnus was standing in the kitchen, far enough back so
the officer couldn"t see him. I whispered, "Tell Nix that some
men are going to come through the house at some point... they"re
not bad men, but they"re not friends. And get word to Hylonome
and Moose if you can. You heard that they want to search the
property."

He nodded, eyes wide, and hurried upstairs. I pulled my
keys out of my pocket and walked out onto the porch, searching
for the padlock key.


"Okay officer... right this way."

When I opened the barn door he whistled. "This is... crazy.
What is it?"

"Art, as far as I know." I walked in and showed him
around. "I don"t think there's ever been any animals in here."


"It's really well built... but what's with all the copper?"


"Again, I don"t know." I opened a stall and he peered in.


"Weird."


"Yeah... my family is a little strange."

He looked at me for a moment and then nodded toward the
other stalls. When we came to the center stall on the right he
asked, "What's with the stool and lantern?"

'sometimes when I need some peace and quiet I come in
here and sit. The lantern helps me meditate."


"Meditate, huh?" He said it like "medicate".


"Mindful meditation..." I shrugged, "It really helps. You
should try it sometime. Does wonders for stress."


"Right." He shook his head and turned.

After a quick but thorough review of the barn, during
which he stopped several times to stomp on the floor and look
for hidden trap doors, we headed out to the Still House.

Opening that door I gestured and said, "You see? Not much
room in here for anything other than the still."

"Right." He headed in and looked around, "What's that
smell?"

"The still is really old. I"ve been trying to clean it
out."


"Open it up." He gestured toward the hatch.

"You don"t seriously think someone's hiding in there, do
you?"


He turned and fixed me with his stare, "Open it up."


"Okay... smell's going to get worse..."

He staggered back, gagging, when the concentrated smell
of Hylonome's base wafted out of the hatch. Eyes watering,
hand on his nose, he peered in, using his flashlight to look
around.

Stepping back he flipped off his flashlight and motioned
for me to close it back up.


'sorry... I did warn you."


"What IS that smell?"

"Years of decay... someone left something in there and it's
been molding ever since."



"Phaugh." He shook his head. "I don"t envy you that job."


"Yeah, me neither."

"Okay then... looks like these buildings are clear." He
turned and I followed him back outside. "What in the world is
THAT?"


"That's the LINternet node. Powers our LINC devices."

He walked through the gate and headed up to the node.
"What's holdin" it up?"


"The node is self-sustaining."


He turned to me and said, "How?"

I shrugged, "You"ll have to ask an expert. It's magic to
me."

"Magic... right..." He turned back and walked all the way
around the sphere. 'so this is what they use for LINC..." He
tilted his head and asked, "How long ago did you put this up?"


"Three days ago."


"Around 1pm or so?"


"Yes... why?"

"Our LINC signals got super clear and strong right around
then." He looked up at the node, "I guess we have you to thank
for that."


"An unintentional benefit."


"Why do you have this?"

I sighed, "My dog Frank has a heart condition. I have
some tools that help me with that, but they"re LINC-driven... I
needed a strong, clear signal."


'so you just went and put up a node, just like that?"


"Well... like I said, my brother works for Livestream... he
hooked me up."


"How much it cost?"


"It was free."


"Free?! Seriously?"


"Yeah..."


"That's one hell of a brother you got there."


'sure is."

"You plannin" on shutting it down or limiting other
folks" access?"

"Not at all. Like I said... I see it as an unintended
benefit, but not unwanted. As long as it continues to be of
help, I"m happy for folks to take advantage of it."


He turned and caught my eye, "Even Keats?"


"Especially Keats."


"Why "especially"?"

I shook my head, "I never wanted to have Keats as an
enemy. I just want to live my life in peace. Somehow we got
off on the wrong foot " really, really wrong " so if maybe he
can see there's some advantage to my being here..." I shrugged,
"I know it's naive, but I figure anything that might help..."


He held my gaze for a moment more and then said, "Right."


"Are we done?"


He gestured at the farmhouse, "Need to check the house."

"Officer, I told you... that man's not here. I don"t even
think he could fit into my house."



He looked at me and said, "I need to check the house."

"Then I"m going to ask you to go get a warrant. I"ve been
completely cooperative, but... enough's enough. If you"re going
to invade my privacy, you"re going to have to do it through
the proper channels."

He stared for a moment and then nodded, "Fair enough." He
pulled out his notepad and made a few more notes. "We"ll be
back soon with that warrant." He leaned closer and said, "And
because you"re requiring a warrant, we are going to be VERY
thorough... don"t want to waste the judges time and all."

"Just be sure to stick to areas that can fit an eight-
foot-tall giant." I gestured toward the driveway. "Goodbye
officer."


"Right." He said and strolled off through the gate.


As soon as he was out of earshot I LINC"d Richard.


"Yes sir, how can I help?"

"Just had a visit from an officer. Poked around a bit and
wants to search the house."


"Did you let him?"

"I asked for a warrant for the house. I showed him the
barn and Still House, though."


"Good. I mean... good you asked for a warrant. Who was it?"


"Damn, I didn"t even ask."

"No matter. It was probably Buckley or Jones... they"re on
Keats" payroll. I"ll call the judge right away and make sure
everything is done correctly."

"Richard, you should know that the house has some secrets
" hidden rooms, that kind of thing."



"Really? Why?"

"No idea. The maintenance man Tumnus who Miss Thatcher
hired lives in one of them, but the others are empty."


"Has that large man ever been inside them?"

"No, and I honestly don"t think he could fit if he tried.
They"re quite narrow... at least the doors and stairs are
narrow."

"Good. I will require they have me on sight to make sure
they don"t go overboard."


"Thank you, Richard, you"re a life saver."

"It's my job, Mr. Adkins... and even if it weren"t I"d be
happy to help." His voice lowered, "I detest what Keats has
done to my hometown."


"Yeah, I can imagine."

"I"ll call the judge straightaway. If the police show up
again, no matter what they say, DON"T let them in your house
until I get there."


"Why?"

"It's a matter of precedent. If they manage to push their
way in without due process, they"ll just continue to push
until something breaks. If we force them to do it by the
books, they"ll likely give up and move on to an easier target.
Have that LINC recorder ready and let them know you"re
recording."


"Damn... I should have thought of that sooner."

"Not a problem. It sounds like whomever it was was fairly
reasonable... he didn"t try to muscle his way into your home,
did he?"

"No, he backed off as soon as I mentioned the warrant.
I"ll remember the LINC next time."


"Just be certain to tell them you"re recording. That
makes everything by the book should anything untoward happen."


"I"ll do that. Thanks again, Richard."


"We"ll talk soon."


As the connection cut off Tumnus came out of the house.


"Is everything alright, Master William?"

"The police are going to come back with a warrant." I
shook my head, "I couldn"t stop them from searching the
house."


"Oh, never you mind, sir..." Tumnus smiled.

"But you... your room under the stairs... and Nix. They"ll be
pawing around making a mess of things. I hate that they"re
going to invade your privacy."

"They"ll never find the room, sir, and Nix is already
aware and has decided to stretch her wings a bit."


"Oh?"

"Yes sir. It's a testament to how well she's doing,
actually... she's been working on flying in her room for the
better part of a day now and she feels ready for a longer
trial."


"Can she warn Moose and Hylonome?"

"That's the plan, sir... and she may even be able to assist
them magically as well." He grinned, "I am so delighted that
she's feeling so well."

'so am I, that's great news!" I breathed a sigh of
relief. "My lawyer said he"ll be here too to help keep the
police in line."


"Ah, yes... Mr. Harding! It will be good to finally meet



"Ah, yes... Mr. Harding! It will be good to finally meet

him. He's been helping us out for years." He paused and then
asked, 'so when are they descending upon us?"

"Not sure. Probably not for a few hours... maybe not until
tomorrow. Richard said he"d let me know."

"Please let me know as soon as you do, sir... I"ll set
things in motion with Nix."


"Perfect. Thank you, Tumnus."

"My pleasure, as always." He bowed and then headed back
into the house. I followed him in and saw Frank and Fezzik
still on their beds. They raised their heads and looked at me,
tails thumping.


"Good boys... you did good... you"re free now."

They jumped up and Fezzik bounded around the room.
Frank's joy was muted... he was really slowing down. I opened
the back door and Fezzik went running off to find Moose. Frank
hung back, sat down next to me, and panted, his tongue lolling
out of his mouth.

"Oh, bud-bud... looks like things are building up in there,
huh?" I sighed and scratched behind his ears. I didn"t want to
perform the procedure too much... even though it was done
laparoscopically it still pierced his chest cavity and
introduced a real risk of infection. If he was visibly slowing
down, though, that meant there was enough fluid to put a
strain on his breathing, and his heart as well. I murmured a
LINC reminder to test him again tomorrow morning, and drain
the fluids even if they weren"t too bad.

"Your big, wonderful, loving, flawed heart." I whispered
and he thumped his tail on the floor as he gazed up at me.


# Ruse


Richard LINC"d me two hours later.

"Mr. Adkins, the good news is they agreed to our terms "
I will be there when they come to inspect the property."


"And the bad news?"

"They"re heading your way with a large contingent of men
" fifteen or so. They called in their part-time support. This
means that I won"t be able to be everywhere... so I have to ask
you again, is there anything on the property that would tie
you to that large man they are searching for?"

"No, nothing. I have no idea where he went." I felt bad
telling this half-truth, but a little better because it was
half true. I had no idea where Moose went. For all I knew it
was somewhere off my property entirely.

"Good." Richard sighed, "They are quite emphatic about
finding and arresting this man. That recording you shared
really scared them."

"As well it should. Someone that large and fast... he could
do some very real damage if he were let loose in a populated
area."

"Indeed. Well... I"ll see you in about 1/2 hour. They are
scheduled to arrive in an hour. I thought it best if I
familiarized myself with things..."


'sounds good. Thanks again, Richard."


"My pleasure."


As he cut the connection I headed into the house.



As he cut the connection I headed into the house.

"Tumnus?"

"Yes, Master William?" Tumnus" voice drifted up through
the secret door to his room. He emerged a moment later, wiping
his hands on a towel. "Is it time?"

"Yes... they"ll be here in about an hour, and Richard will
be here sooner."

"Would you like me to be present when the police are
here? Richard knows I live here, and may wonder..."

"We should ask Richard about that. They"re not searching
for you, so I don"t know that they need to know you"re here."

"I"ve taken the liberty to move some things into the
third guest room, sir, just in case." Tumnus smiled, "It's
actually quite cozy in there... and light."

"Well you"re welcome to sleep anywhere you"d like,
Tumnus... perhaps you should rotate through the bedrooms for a
change of scenery."

He laughed and said, "What a marvelous idea... but no, I"m
quite comfortable in my den below. It's quite similar to the
traditional homes we Fauns create for ourselves, though I must
admit it's a bit more comfortably furnished."

I realized I had never seen his room... or rooms. For all I
knew he had a master suite down there... and I hoped he did.
"I"m glad... you deserve the best."

"Thank you, Sir." He inclined his head and folded the
towel, placing it on the table. "I will go inform Nix... and
make sure our ruse is foolproof."


"Thank you, Tumnus."

I puttered around the kitchen, calming my nerves. At one
point I felt a surge of energy flow through me " my hair stood
on end and everything became incredibly crisp for an instant,
like someone turned up the contrast on my vision. I looked
around and saw no changes, wondering if perhaps Nix had worked
some of her magic.


I went and sat on the porch chair, breathing and letting
my thoughts drift. Right on time, Richard pulled up into the
driveway in a dark blue Lincoln town car.

"Huh... I wonder if that's a thing up here..." I muttered as
I stood, smiled, and waved at him.

Tumnus came out of the house, adjusting his vest and
smoothing the fur on his head. Richard emerged from his car,
smiling, and called out to us.

"Mr. Adkins! Good to see you." He was dressed similarly
to when I met him... old fashioned brown suit, white shirt, and
light reddish-brown tie. He reached over to the passenger side
and pulled out a briefcase. "Be right with you."

"Take your time." I replied. Tumnus hummed and fidgeted,
hands shifting between adjusting his vest and tugging at his
beard. "You okay, Tumnus?"


"I always get a little nervous around people."


"You hide it well."


"Thank you." He smiled nervously at me. "I am trying."


"Just breathe. You"ll be fine."

He nodded and took a deep breath, his shoulders relaxing
visibly.

Richard walked up and held out his hand to me. "Mr.
Adkins."

I shook his hand and smiled, saying, "Unless you"d like
me to start calling you Mr. Harding... please call me Will."

He brightened and smiled back, "Thank you! I will... Will.
Miss Thatcher, of course, was always Miss Thatcher no matter
what..."


"As it should be." We chuckled and Richard turned to



"As it should be." We chuckled and Richard turned to

Tumnus. "Richard, this is Tumnus. He's been caretaker of the
estate for quite some time."

"Mr. Tumnus. It's so good to meet you." He held out his
hand.

"I am, thank you, Mr. Harding..." He took a deep breath and
shook Richard's hand. "I appreciate all you"ve done on our
behalf."

"Likewise, Mr. Tumnus... you have done wonders keeping this
place up." Richard chuckled and straightened. "Now... let's take
a look around. Don"t want any surprises..."

We went through the house. Richard was very careful...
taking pictures and jotting down notes. At one point Richard
looked out one of the bedroom windows in the back of the house
and did a double-take.


"Is that the node?"

"Yes. Oh! Man... I"m so sorry. I was supposed to check with
you about the regulations."

Richard nodded, "Well, there are permits you"re supposed
to get, but most of the regulations fall in the same
categories as those for cell towers " height, visibility, and
preventing damage should the supporting structure collapse."
He peered at the node. "What's holding it up?"

"Nothing. The nodes are apparently self-sustaining and
fixed in space once they are complete."

"Interesting." He thought for a moment, "Well, I suggest
we apply for permits retroactively... I know the folks at the
permit office so I can probably fudge the dates a little." He
paused and then added, "Tell me, did that node come online
earlier this week?"


"Yes, three days ago."

"Hmmm... then perhaps I shall have to take a different
approach... asking forgiveness rather than pretending we did
this the right way."



"Why is that?"

"Pretty much everyone with a LINC for many miles around
knows when this came online. Every signal suddenly got much
stronger, and I"ve heard reports of folks as far away as Mt.
Katahdin reporting they suddenly had LINC service where none
previously existed."


'sorry about this... I should have followed up with you."

Richard chuckled and said, "No harm done. Really... folks
are enjoying a real boost in LINC, for free... you don"t intend
on limiting this or charging for it in any way?"

"No, absolutely not. I think of it as an unexpected
benefit that everyone should share."

"Excellent. I can"t imagine the county will take
exception to this, especially because they benefit as well.
They may grumble but I"ll handle that."


"Thank you, again, Richard, for bailing me out."


"My pleasure, Will."

Ten minutes later we were in the kitchen and we heard
tires on gravel. I was just finishing up stuffing peanut
butter into a pair of giant-sized Kongs, under the watchful
stares of the pups.

"And here they are." Richard said. He turned to Tumnus,
"You don"t need to be here if you don"t want to, Mr. Tumnus. I
know that this police business can be quite stressful. You
might take yourself to the barn or Still House for the
duration if you"d like. Their warrant covers the house and the
grounds, but not those two buildings."

"I will... thank you Mr. Harding." Tumnus looked relieved
as he turned and headed out the back door. "Good luck!"

We headed out to the front and saw that there were two
police cars and two other cars lined up along the drive.
Twelve men - four in uniform - gathered on the drive, talking


Twelve men - four in uniform - gathered on the drive, talking

quietly amongst themselves.

"I"ll handle them. Best if you don"t talk with them... and
only answer questions that I agree are appropriate."


"Of course. Thanks."

Richard walked out to meet them and I turned back to the
house, spotting Frank and Fezzik at the screen door staring at
the new arrivals.

"Okay, boys, you know the drill." I gestured for them to
go to their beds and gave them each a Kong. As they dug in I
returned to the porch.

The officer who I met earlier and a man in civilian
clothes followed Richard to the house. The other men split
into five groups of two and headed off in different
directions. Each group had an old-fashioned paper map and
markers.

"Mr. Adkins, this is officer Buckley, whom I believe
you"ve already met. His partner is Mr. Spelding... of the police
reserves."

Spelding held out his hand. "Good to meet you, Mr.
Adkins."


I shook his hand and nodded. "Likewise."

Buckley handed two pieces of paper to Richard, who
reviewed them and then passed one of them to me. "It's all in
order... that's your copy, William. Now, gentlemen... I know I
shouldn"t have to say this, but just to be sure... you are
looking for a very large man, or signs of a very large man,
estimated to be over seven feet tall."


"Your point is?" Buckley said, frowning.

"My point is this man can not possibly hide in cabinets,
cupboards, drawers, or containers of any kind. This warrant
clearly states your objective, and that does NOT include
rifling through any of Mr. Adkins personal effects. Doing so
will violate the terms of the warrant." He turned toward me


will violate the terms of the warrant." He turned toward me

and nodded. "Both Mr. Adkins and I will be recording the
entire process using our LINCs... which you both know is
admissible in court, so... please adhere to the agreement, and
we"ll get this done quickly and smoothly."

"Right." Buckley said, frown deepening. Richard and I
murmured into our LINCs, activating the recording.

"Let's go, Bob." Spelding said to Buckley. "We don"t want
to drag this out."

Buckley glowered at me for a moment and then followed
Spalding into the house.

The entire process took less than 30 minutes. Richard had
to remind Buckley several times that a seven-foot-tall man
couldn"t possibly fit in the spaces he was investigating.
Buckley's mood darkened throughout the process, but Spalding
remained calm and professional.

At one point Buckley looked like he was about to lose his
temper, and Spalding told him to calm down or he"d be asked to
step outside. Buckley held his tongue, and I wondered how it
was that a civilian could pull rank like that.

Of course they found nothing... not even a footprint that
could be construed as fitting Moose's enormous feet.

"Thank you, Mr. Adkins, for your cooperation." Spalding
once again shook my hand as they prepared to leave.

"Thank you, Mr. Spalding, for your professionalism." I
replied, careful not to look at Buckley. "It was a pleasure to
meet you."


"Whatever." Buckley muttered and Spalding frowned at him.

"Okay, that's our cue to leave." Spalding all but pushed
Buckley down the porch stairs. "Richard... always a pleasure,
sir."


"Likewise, George."


They headed to one of the police cars. Buckley was in a
foul mood, storming over, throwing open the driver-side door,
and slamming it once he got in.


We shut off our recordings and I turned to Richard.

"What was that all about?" I shook my head, "It was like
a textbook "good cop bad cop" scene."

As Buckley peeled out of the driveway Richard smiled and
said, "That, my friend, was one of the strings I pulled." He
turned to me and said, "I knew they"d need extra men, so I
requested that George help out with searching the house. He's
their former captain... just retired... and an old friend."


"Genius." I said.

"I thought so." Richard chuckled and added, "Might I
trouble you for a drink of something?"


"Alcoholic or otherwise?"

He laughed and said, "Unfortunately, while the police are
on the grounds, I"m still officially working. However... perhaps
someday soon I"ll take you up on the alcoholic version."

We headed inside and chatted over glasses of lemonade.
Tumnus came in a little while later and joined us, and the
three of us sat around the table enjoying each other's
company.

Two hours later, as the sun was setting, the other police
straggled out of the forest. Tumnus was preparing dinner and
Richard was finishing up his official report, murmuring into
his LINC, as they appeared and headed for their cars.

Richard walked out onto the porch, turning his recording
back on. "Find anything, Gentlemen?"

"Tim found a wasps nest." One of the uniformed officers
chuckled.


"Oh, ouch! Is he okay?"


"Yeah, great." A man in civvis grumbled, rubbing his leg
as he walked past.


'so nothing else to report? This is for the record..."

"No sir, nothing." The officer who responded first
stopped and turned. "No sign of habitation of any kind... and
certainly nothing that could hide a giant."


"Thank you, Officer... may I have your name?"


"Thompson. Doug Thompson... with a "p"."

"Thank you officer Thompson." Richard stopped his
recording.

Thompson nodded and followed the rest of the men to the
cars. Their energy was subdued as they climbed in and drove
away.

Richard turned to me and said, "Well, with that... I must
depart."

"Won"t you join us for dinner? Tumnus is an excellent
cook."

"No, thank you. I promised Marjorie I"d be home for
dinner. Looks like I"ll be right on time."

I held out my hand. "Thank you again, Richard... you"re
awesome."

He smiled and shook hands, "Truly a pleasure, William.
This was, of course, official business, so I"ll send you the
invoice tomorrow. Take your time paying..."


"Thank you."

He nodded and headed back to his car. As he drove off
Frank emerged from the house and walked over to sit next to
me.



"All's well that ends well, eh bud-bud?"

He seemed to nod as he stared out at the road. I found
myself wondering, not for the first time, about how much Frank
really understood. I knelt down and hugged him as he leaned
against me.


"I love you, bud-bud."


He slurped my face, grinning up at me.


...and that was the last time I got a kiss from Frank.


# Summons

"Master William! Come quickly!" Tumnus shouted from
outside my room. I opened my eyes and sat up groggily.
Glancing at the clock I saw that it was a few minutes to
midnight.


"What... what is it, Tumnus?"


You are needed. The Lady's thoughts flowed into my head.

"Oh shit." I jumped out of bed and struggled into my robe
and slippers. Stumbling down the stairs I saw Tumnus running
out the side door toward the barn.

"Quickly, Master William!" He called out. "Bring your
keys!"

"I"m coming!" I shouted back, cursing as I headed back up
the stairs. It took me a moment to find my pants and grab my
keys.

I stumbled and nearly fell on my way back down, running
as fast as I could across the kitchen.

As I pushed through the side door I saw that the barn was
lit up from inside, lights pulsing and wavering through the
skylights. Frank and Fezzik paced around in front of the door,
and a bright point of light weaved above them. Frank had
something trailing from his mouth... some kind of rope or
something he had clamped in his teeth.


I ran over to the barn, fumbling with the keys.


Hurry! Midnight is upon us!


I found the padlock key, unlocked the door, and pushed it



I found the padlock key, unlocked the door, and pushed it

open. The intense, bright light blinded me and I stumbled back
as Frank and Fezzik ran into the barn. As they passed I saw
that Frank had the end of a long strip of silk in his mouth.
It floated and danced behind him as he ran past.

"Wait! FRANK!" I shouted as he leapt into the glow, which
was centered over the pattern on the floor.

He vanished, followed an instant later by Fezzik. As
Fezzik passed, the light began to fade.

"FRANK!" I fell backward, landing hard, knocking the wind
out of me. "FUCK!"


They are needed.

"You don"t understand! Frank's condition..." I wheezed, "...
he needs treatment!"


I... am sorry. There was only this one window...


" Couldn"t... you take... me instead?"

_You are not pure of heart. You could not pass through the
gate._

I nodded and sat there, catching my breath. "How... how
long?"


How long will they be with us? I don"t know.

I managed to regain some composure. "Please... he's got
only a day or two before he's going to be in real trouble...
he's sick and needs his treatment. Please try to get him back
here before that."


We will do our best.

I sat there staring at the pattern, which was still
glowing faintly. Tumnus came up behind me and put his hand on
my shoulder.


"Master William... I"m so sorry..."



I put my hand on his and felt tears welling up.

An image of a sad Faerie face floated into my mind. I
looked up to see Nix drifting through the air above us. The
image shifted to one of the tiny glowing creature hugging
Frank.

"Yeah... I know..." I sniffed. "You love him too..." I chuckled
half-heartedly, "I think it's impossible not to love Frank."

The sad face returned and I felt a warm glow suffuse me.
I closed my eyes, breathed in, and tried to let go of my fear.

After a few minutes I stood, brushing off, and discovered
I had ripped the back of my robe.

"Oh... I"ll attend to that first thing, Master William."
Tumnus said. 'shan"t take but a moment to fix."


"Thanks Tumnus... but it can wait for morning."

I stepped up to the barn door, and with one last look at
the pattern, I sighed and slid the door shut, locking it with
the padlock.

Together Tumnus, Nix, and I headed slowly back to the
farmhouse.


# Waiting

The next day I was a mess. When my LINC informed me it
was time to check on Frank, I swore and threw a mini temper
tantrum, nearly ripping the earbud out of my ear. Fortunately
I was alone, sitting on the porch with a cup of coffee. I only
managed to spill coffee on myself, which, of course,
frustrated me even more.

Mid-morning I was still sitting there trying to get a
handle on my fear when Moose wandered up. I heard him at
first, heavy footsteps on the drive, and it took me a moment
to spot him. My eyes kept on sliding off whenever I tried to
look at him.

I stood and headed toward him. "Moose? What are you
doing?!"

"It's alright, Master William." Tumnus appeared at the
kitchen door. "Nix has rendered him all but invisible."

"Fuck." I muttered and Moose stopped mid-stride. I
couldn"t read his expression, but I realized he heard my
frustration. 'sorry Moose... I"m just... really afraid for Frank
and Fezzik."


'sorry..." Moose mumbled, "Miss Fezzik. Miss Frank."


"Yeah... me too."

Moose stepped close and put his giant hand on my
shoulder. His touch was gentle... tender... caring.

I gripped his hand, struck by how tiny mine was in
comparison, and said, "Thank you, Moose... you"re a good
friend."


"Friend." Moose agreed. He squeezed my shoulder softly
and then turned to leave. "You need... you call. Moose come."


"I will, thank you Moose."

I turned back, wiping my eyes, and headed into the
kitchen.

"Moose really likes you." Tumnus said, quietly, "I"ve
never seen him, or any other ogre for that matter, offer to
help anyone before."


"He seems like a good ogre."

"Ogres are neither good nor evil, Master William. They"re
followers, and they will do what their told without any moral
judgment. They are truly amoral creatures."


'so I guess I"ll just have to be a good leader then."


"You are that, Master William... without a doubt."


"Thank you Tumnus."


"Are you hungry, sir?"


"No..." I sighed. "Though I probably should eat something."


"I agree. I"ll fix you something straightaway."

After my late breakfast Tumnus went off to do some chores
and I wandered out to the barn. On the way there my LINC
chirped with a call from Ahmer's assistant.


I sighed and answered.

"Mr. Adkins? Good news, sir. You"ve been approved for the
monitoring and defense equipment. It should all be ready in a
few days. Are you available sometime later in the week?"


"What for?"


"Well... for installation, of course. They will need to



"Well... for installation, of course. They will need to

take measurements, install the sensors... the process will
likely take the better part of a day given the size of your
property."

"Hmmm... I"m kind of busy this week." I didn"t want them
here when Frank returned... but if he wasn"t back by next week...
"How about we schedule it for next week?"


"Perfect. What day works for you?"


"Wednesday." That gave Frank eight days.

"I"ll get that scheduled for you then. Is there anything
else I can help you with?"


"No, that's it. Thank you."


"My pleasure, Mr. Adkins."

I signed off and stepped up to the barn door. I stared at
it for a moment, last night's events replaying in my head, and
wondered why I was there.

When no reasons came to mind I shrugged and unlocked the
door, letting myself in. A strong smell of ozone suffused the
otherwise dry and dusty air, and I felt the hairs on my arms
and neck stand up.

Careful not to touch the pattern, I headed to the central
stall. I set up the lantern and the stool, lit the lantern,
and sat back, closing my eyes and trying to relax.

I didn"t want to disturb the Lady in case she was busy
helping the pups, so I didn"t try to communicate with her. I
sat there for a while, meditating and letting go.


After some time I heard hooves on the stone floor.

'she won"t be able to answer your questions." Hylonome
said, voice soft.


"I know. I... I"m just trying to let go of my fear."



"It's a burden, this caring so for others."

I opened my eyes to see her standing next to the stall,
resting one hand on the stall door and peering at me. She
looked worried.

"Yes, and... caring for others is one of the reasons we"re
here." I sighed, "At least, that's how I feel."

"It is a good feeling." Hylonome said gently, "One that I
often forget."


"Is there something I can do to help you?"

"I am here to help you. I will answer any and all
questions you have to the best of my ability."


"Why the change of heart?"

"You have proven yourself worthy... and you are making one
of the biggest sacrifices a being can make."

I nodded, "Yeah. It would be so much easier if it was
me..." I sighed, "I can"t stand this waiting and not knowing."

"I know." She shifted slightly, her hooves loud on the
stone floor. "Now... what questions do you have?"

I thought for a moment and then gestured around the barn,
"What is this? I mean, I know it's a gate... but..." I shook my
head, "It's probably a stupid question, but... how does it
work?"

"That is a very good question, with a very complicated
answer if I were to attempt to explain the full process.
However..." She paused and collected her thoughts, "...it can be
summed up as a transference of energy through an alignment of
the planes. Similar to a drawbridge, if you will pardon the
over-simplification. Both sides of the bridge are constructed
to synchronize the planes. When conditions are right, with a
"push" of magic, the bridge connects both sides of the gate
and creatures are able to pass through."


"That's... incredible. How do they pass through? I mean... do
they disappear from one side and appear on the other?"

"Beings cannot teleport across planes. The process is
phased and unidirectional. The beings soul passes through
first, then, if it has sufficient will, it's physical body is
drawn across."

'sufficient will? You mean Frank and Fezzik could have
died?"

"Oh yes. Once the soul is separate from the body there's
a short period of time in which they could perish. Fortunately
most living things have a very strong will to live... there have
only been a few cases where the passage itself has resulted in
dissolution of life."


"Is there anything else that can go wrong?"

Hylonome gazed at me and sighed. "Yes... as I said it's a
very complex process. Given that this gate is properly
constructed and aligned, most of the problems that can occur
are unlikely at best. However well constructed the gate is,
the transference must not be interrupted or the results will
be catastrophic."


"Catastrophic how?"

"Best case scenario is death of the transported being
and-or the interloper who interferes with the transference.
Worst case... the gates destroy themselves in a cataclysmic
explosion." She saw my expression and shook her head,
"Fortunately the period of time between when the soul first
arrives and the body is assembled is very short... only a second
or two at most... a little longer for larger creatures."


'so stay away from an active transference... got it."


"Is there anything else you want to know?"

I chuckled, "Only a million things, but I don"t want to
keep you. I really appreciate you coming here and helping me
understand... Some day I"d like to hear about the land you came
from."


She sighed and said, "That is a long, and unfortunately
very sad tale." She regarded me for a moment and then said,
"One which I will be honored to share with you sometime in the
future. Perhaps after things settle a bit."


I stood and bowed. "Hylonome... thank you."

"Thatcher... thank you for your sacrifice. Your companions
are trying to save my people... and for that we will forever be
in their debt... and yours."

She turned and strode out of the barn. I leaned over and
extinguished the lamp, replacing everything and closing the
stall before heading out of the barn.

As I closed the barn door I thought about what happened
last night, and instead of locking the padlock I hung it
through the loops on the sliding bar, pushing it to but not
locking it. I didn"t want anything to delay Frank and Fezzik's
return.


# Sacrifice

I meandered around the rest of the day, trying hard not
to snap at anyone, unable to find anything that could distract
me for long.

I lay awake that night, checking the clock every few
minutes. Midnight came and went, and when the birds started
chirping, announcing the dawning of the day, I finally drifted
off to sleep.

The next day was much like the previous. Sam called me in
the middle of the day but I didn"t feel like talking, so I
didn"t answer and messaged her that I was caught up in things.
We made a phone date for Sunday. I figured it"d be over, one
way or another, in a few day's time.

At one point in the late afternoon an image floated into
my mind... this time the bright glowing creature was hugging me.

"Thank you, Nix... I really appreciate it." I sent thoughts
of gratitude but couldn"t bring myself to reach out any more
than that.

That night I went to bed fully dressed and fell asleep
quickly, only to be awakened by Tumnus at midnight.


"Master William!"

I was up and out of bed in an instant, though I nearly
tumbled down the stairs as I tried to descend while putting on
my boots.

The barn was lit up as before. Tumnus was pulling open
the door as I ran out.


Hylonome and Moose were both there, standing in the



Hylonome and Moose were both there, standing in the

shadows at the edge of the forest.


I raced for the barn and Tumnus shouted, "He's here!"

As I reached the door Frank stumbled out of the barn, the
long ribbon of silk clutched between his teeth. Four small
childlike figures clung to the ribbon, pulled through the door
one-by-one.

Once the last one was free Frank collapsed, gasping and
gurgling, letting go of the ribbon.

"Oh god FRANK!" I raced up and knelt next to him. He
raised his head and looked at me, wheezing, and thumped his
tail twice before lying back down.

I pressed my ear to his chest and heard his heart
hammering irregularly... I also heard the fluid bubbling clearly
with every strained breath.

There was only one way to save him. I leapt up and raced
back to my truck. When I got there there was a shout and
Fezzik staggered out of the barn, three small figures on his
back. When he was clear of the door he stumbled, sprawling on
the ground next to Frank.

I grabbed the backpack with the LINC gloves and armature
and raced back.

When I was halfway there I heard a roar and the light in
the barn brightened until I could no longer look directly at
it. The roar deepened and grew louder and the large doors at
the back end of the barn flew open, locks and splintered wood
flying into the darkness. I stumbled and fell, stunned by the
blast. Fezzik struggled to get up but he was tangled with the
beings on his back. Moose, Hylonome, and Tumnus staggered
backwards transfixed with fear.

Frank struggled to his feet. I could see him barking
though I couldn"t hear him for the howling roar coming from a
massive serpentine figure, it's coalescing body large enough
to span the entire barn.


Frank leapt forward.


"Oh god Frank... NO!" I jumped to my feet, abandoning the
backpack in my desperation to reach Frank before...

Frank hit the pattern and another blinding flash of light
burst forth, together with a silent concussion that knocked us
all to the ground.


"No no no no..." I screamed as I staggered to my feet.

Frank came out of the barn, snarling and snapping, his
eyes glowing bright red. He whirled and snapped at Fezzik, who
cowered back, confused.

Then Frank spotted me and lunged, howling with rage. He
closed the distance quickly, but just before he reached me he
yelped, choked, and fell to the ground.

He slid a foot or so and lay still, his last breath
gurgling out of his lungs, glow fading from his eyes, staring
blankly up at me.

The image was identical to the one that Nix showed me the
first time we met.

"Oh... god..." I whispered, reaching a trembling hand out to
touch his still face.

"Fezzik! Stop!" Hylonome shouted. I looked up to see
Fezzik running toward the massive black dragon's head emerging
from the barn. Hylonome and Tumnus reared back, shouting in a
strange melodious language, and Moose charged after Fezzik.


STOP!

The Lady's voice rang in my head. Hylonome and Tumnus
faltered, the flickering lights at their fingertips fading
away. Fezzik reached the dragon, spun and growled at Moose,
hackles raised. Moose stumbled, confused, and fell to his
hands and knees.

"Fezzik!" I yelled, struggling to my feet. He continued
posturing in front of Moose, who sat back and gazed up at the


posturing in front of Moose, who sat back and gazed up at the

dragon, hands raised in fists, face contorted in fear.

The dragon raised it's head and bumped it on the door
frame, cracking the wood. It winced and twisted it's head,
glancing at the damage it had done.

"Oops. Sorry." The dragon's voice was so deep I felt it
in my chest. It gently laid it's head down next to Fezzik, who
quieted, turned, and licked it's tremendous scaled snout.


Hylonome, Tumnus and Moose lowered their hands.


"What's... what's going on?" I asked.

Tumnus gestured at the dragon and said, "Look at his
eyes."

The dragon turned it's head toward me, nearly knocking
Fezzik down.

It's eyes were a soulful brown, full of love and wisdom...
and a touch of confusion.


"You!" It's voice rumbled. "You are important, somehow."

I glanced down at Frank's body and back up at the dragon.
The dragon followed my glance, raised an eyebrow, and nodded.


"I see. Interesting."

I got to my feet and stared at the Dragon. "Uh... what's
interesting? Who are you?"

"It seems the soul trap works." The dragon turned and
faced Moose and the others. "Will you release the bindings? I
feel a need to stretch... and, for some strange reason... to
dance."

"No." Hylonome shook her head. "Not until we"re sure... we
would be fools to trust you."

"You are wise." The dragon nodded, sighed, and laid their
head back down. "In answer to your second question, Human-who-


head back down. "In answer to your second question, Human-who-

is-important, I am, or was, Runihara, the Dark Mother's second
in command."


" Was?"

"My soul no longer burns with hatred and fear. I must
return and seek out the Bright Lady... she will know how I may
make amends for the evil deeds I have done."


Come, Runihara... and be reborn.

"Our paths will cross again, Human-who-is-important...
Ogre-who-is-friend..." Runihara turned it's head and bumped
Fezzik gently, knocking him over again, "...Brother-of-my-soul."

Fezzik jumped up and barked, wagging like crazy, and
crouched down in a "play-with-me" stance.

I had no idea what to say, so I said the first thing that
came to mind. "Take care... and dance joyfully."

Runihara gazed at me for a moment and then said,
"Farewell."

He closed his eyes and a shimmering aura suffused his
being. Moose picked up Fezzik and stepped back. Fezzik whined
and struggled to get free, but Moose held him easily as
Runihara faded away.


# Passage

I looked at the creatures clustered around the barn door.
One of the childlike faeries was lying on the ground bleeding
from a nasty gash on her head. The other fairies were
clustered around her, wringing their hands and fretting.

I looked down at Frank's body, limp and lifeless, and a
sob escaped my lips. Wordlessly, numb but knowing that I had
to help the faeries, I stumbled over and picked up my
backpack.

The others watched as I headed for the wounded Faerie. I
fumbled a bit putting the armature together, and when I turned
it on and investigated her injury I discovered that the cut
was sliced across her skull but didn"t penetrate it. The
armature worked quickly to anesthetize, clean, and close the
wound. I was grateful because I knew I would not be able to
such a good job on my own.

As I did this, Fezzik and Moose walked over to Frank, and
Fezzik sniffed and poked at him, trying to wake him up. I
stifled another sob... I had to focus and finish my work.

When I was done I saw that the other two faeries Fezzik
had carried were also injured. They stared at me, wide-eyed,
but let me attend to their wounds, only shrinking back a
little when I first touched them. Both needed stitches, one on
her thigh and the other on her side.

When I was done I shut off the gloves and placed them on
the ground, hands shaking.

When I looked around I saw that someone had lit some
lanterns and placed them around Frank. They provided the only
illumination now that the patterns in the barn were no longer
glowing and I was no longer using the gloves. Moose sat next


glowing and I was no longer using the gloves. Moose sat next

to the body, cradling Fezzik, tears flowing down his cheeks.

When I returned to Frank and knelt, cradling his head in
my lap, I started crying in earnest. Tumnus stepped up beside
me and put his hand on my shoulder, which, of course, only
caused me to cry harder.

After a time I realized I could hear something very soft,
right at the edge of perception. I was spent, having cried all
I could at the moment, so I sat back and listened.

Nix floated nearby, surrounded by six of the seven
faeries Frank and Fezzik had saved. They were all singing in a
language I couldn"t understand, but I could feel the sorrow
and the gratitude in their voices.

This went on for a while, and then Tumnus gasped quietly,
squeezing my shoulder and whispering, "Master William... please
do not be alarmed... but Twitch is here."

I looked up and was about to ask who that was when a tall
humanoid shape formed of branches and vines stepped out of the
shadows. He stopped, his strange luminescent green eyes
staring at me, and he slowly gestured toward Frank.


"Twitch minds the graveyard. No one knows why."


I wiped my nose, holding Twitches gaze. "Graveyard?"

"The Thatcher family graveyard... have you not seen it?
Several of your ancestors are resting there, including Miss
Thatcher." Tumnus gestured at Frank. "Twitch wants to honor
Frank's sacrifice... give him a proper burial in a place of
honor."

I thought for a moment and then nodded to Twitch. I laid
Frank's head on the ground as carefully as I could and slid
back to give Twitch some room. Twitch stepped up and gently
lifted Frank, sprouting several more arms in order to support
him properly. He stood for a moment, gazing at me, and then
turned and slowly walked back the way he came.

Tumnus picked up a lantern and nodded toward Twitch's
receding form. "After you, Master William."


I stood shakily and followed Twitch's slow and solemn
march. The others fell in behind me, the faeries still singing
softly at the center of the group. Mylonome carried the
unconscious faery on her back, moving carefully to ensure she
didn"t fall off. Fezzik walked up next to me, pushing his head
underneath my hand, letting me know he was there.

Twitch led us past the Mill House and into the woods,
where a well-hidden path led up to low stone wall surrounding
a graveyard a hundred feet into the forest.

There were twenty or so gravestones there, each at the
head of a well-tended mound. Flowers and sprigs of various
plants lay on each grave. I spotted Elijah's grave, and
Tobias"... and Sarah Thatcher's.

There was an open grave off in one corner with a blank
stone at its head.

Twitch gently lowered Frank into the grave, his many arms
extending smoothly until Frank rested at the bottom. He then
withdrew his arms, reabsorbing all but two, and turned to me.

Tumnus whispered, "He wants to know what the gravestone
should say."

_Frank, who saved us all._ The Lady's voice came clearly to
my mind. It felt as if she were standing right beside me.

No one moved, so I assumed they had not heard her. I
repeated her words, voice trembling. "Frank... who saved us
all."

Twitch nodded and turned, grasping the stone firmly.
Multiple limbs sprang out of his chest and he hammered the
stone, quickly chipping out the Lady's words. In less than a
minute Twitch turned and placed the gravestone at the head of
Frank's grave.


He then stepped back and once again turned to me.

"Thank you, Twitch..." I whispered, barely able to speak. I
breathed in and let the sorrow and gratitude I felt fill my


breathed in and let the sorrow and gratitude I felt fill my

heart.


He nodded and bowed his head.

I knelt down next to the grave and said, quietly, "Hey,
bud-bud... you did good. It was a"" I sobbed and had to stop for
a moment to collect myself. "It was an honor and a privilege
to know you, Frank. You"re the best... the best friend..."

I stopped, unable to continue, and sat back, letting my
tears flow freely. Fezzik came up beside me and lay his head
on my lap. I looked up at Twitch and nodded.

With amazing speed he filled in the grave. When he was
done he pushed a single flowering laurel branch into the fresh
mound of dirt.

One by one the other creatures stepped up and placed a
flower or branch on Frank's grave. One by one, after placing
their offering, each turned to me and touched the top of my
head, murmuring something in their own language.

When the last faery approached I saw that it was the one
with the head injury. Instead of touching my head she threw
her arms around me and hugged me tightly.

I hugged her back, and another image floated into my
mind... this one of me surrounded by smiling, dancing faeries.

I smiled and nodded, whispering, "Thank you... though I may
not dance anytime soon... I look forward to the day when we can
dance together."

Moose, Hylonome, and the faeries walked quietly away, and
Twitch faded into the background, leaving Tumnus, Fezzik and I
by Frank's graveside.

"He really saved us all, you know." Tumnus sniffed,
wiping his eyes.

"What happened? Runihara said something about a 'soul
trap"..."


"Apparently Frank managed to step into the precise
position at the precise time... it seems that Frank's soul
entered Runihara's body, pushing Runihara's soul into Frank's
ailing body."

"Are we sure that happened? I mean... Runihara might have
been lying."

"They had no reason to lie. If they had finished
materializing and retained their original evil soul, we would
all be dead."


"Runihara said something about seeking out the Lady..."


He is here now. We are... discussing matters.


"My Lady?" I said, "Will he help us?"

_That is his intention, however, it is complicated.
Frank's is a gentle soul, and that is not what we need right
now... but that is my concern, not yours._

"I..." I wasn"t sure how to take all of this. Frank was
gone, but somehow lived on in as different a body as I could
imagine... I couldn"t think of what to say, so I added simply,
"...thank you, My Lady."

_It is we who must thank you, William Thatcher Adkins... you
have truly saved us by nurturing such a kind and good creature
and bringing them to us. Please give the same loving care to
the Faeries. They are our hope and our salvation."_

"I will, My Lady... because... Frank..." I took a deep breath.
"I will."

_Farewell... I fear we will not speak again for some time.
Many things are happening now that require my attention. Watch
the patterns. Now that the Faeries are there with you more of
my people will follow._

_"_ We will." I looked up at Tumnus and saw that he was
staring at me, wide-eyed.



Farewell... The Lady's thoughts faded.


"Was that?" Tumnus" voice quavered.

"The Lady. She said more will come now the Faeries are
here. We must watch the patterns... and we have to repair the
barn as well. She who gave us Frank's epitaph as well."


"I see." He nodded, "Indeed there is much work to do."

I stared down at Frank's grave. "I know he wasn"t here
long, but... it's just not going to be the same without him." I
sighed.

"No, it won"t." Tumnus said quietly. "He was a remarkable
being, and his soul lives on to do remarkable things, I"m
sure."

I sat for a time with Fezzik's head on my lap. After a
while Tumnus left, moving quietly. When Fezzik started snoring
I realized it was time to go.

I stood and said to the woods around me, "Thank you
again, Twitch. I will want to come back here from time to
time... would that be okay?"

The wind sighed through the trees and I felt a sense of
calm flow through me.

"Thank you." I looked down at Fezzik who was sitting
staring up at me blearily. "Come on, Fezzik... let's go home."


He stood and we walked slowly back to the farmhouse...


...back to a world that was just a little bit emptier.
